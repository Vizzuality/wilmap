64,General Introduction - Caricom,General Introduction - Caricom,"Summary: Jurisdictions of the Caribbean Region are generally still in the process of implementing policies for their ICT (Information and Communications Technologies) sectors. On the issue of Intermediary Liability, the States that have passed statutory provisions have done so by including such provisions in their Electronic Transactions Acts (which are meant to primarily deal with the authentication of electronic documents and signatures). In general, where such provisions exist, they are based on the mere conduit principle. However, there are no known instances in any Caribbean jurisdiction where the court has heard a case on intermediary liability. In 2009, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) funded the HIPCAR Project (Enhancing competitiveness in the Caribbean through the harmonization of ICT Policies, Legislation and Regulatory Procedures). The beneficiary countries were the States of CARICOM (the Caribbean Community). This project included an assessment of each beneficiary country’s ICT legislation, including Electronic Transactions, within which the issue of Intermediary Liability was included. The project also resulted in ‘Regional Model Policies and Regulations’. For most Caribbean States with recent legislation, the Electronic Transactions Act (and hence Intermediary Liability) generally resembles this model legislation. For those countries that have not yet passed legislation (or are to consider updating their laws), it can be anticipated that the draft bills will also follow the form of the model legislative texts. The provisions on Intermediary Liability are contained in PART IV (SS26-28) of the model legislative text on Electronic Transactions.

(1) Definition of Intermediary. An ‘Intermediary’ with respect to any particular electronic records is defined under Section 2(w) of the Information Technology Act as ‘any person who on behalf of another person receives, stores or transmits that record or provides any service with respect to that record and includes telecom service providers, network service providers, internet service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online-auction sites, online-marketplaces and cyber cafes.'

(2) Safe Harbour Provisions. Under Section 79 of the IT Act, intermediaries are exempted from liability in certain cases. Section 79 states that an intermediary shall not be liable:
Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force but subject to the provisions of sub-sections (2) and (3), an intermediary shall not be liable for any third party information, data, or communication link made available or hasted by him.
The provisions of sub-section (1) shall apply if—(a) the function of the intermediary is limited to providing access to a communication system over which information made available by third parties is transmitted or temporarily stored or hasted; or (b) the intermediary does not—(i) initiate the transmission, (ii) select the receiver of the transmission, and (iii) select or modify the information contained in the transmission; (c) the intermediary observes due diligence while discharging his duties under this Act and also observes such other guidelines as the Central Government may prescribe in this behalf.
The provisions of sub-section (1) shall not apply if—(a) the intermediary has conspired or abetted or aided or induced, whether by threats or promise or authorise in the commission of the unlawful act; (b) upon receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit the unlawful act, the intermediary fails to expeditiously remove or disable access to that material on that resource without vitiating the evidence in any manner. Explanation.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “third party information” means any information dealt with by an intermediary in his capacity as an intermediary.""]

(3) Data retention and intermediaries. According to Section 67C of the IT Act, intermediaries are required by law to ‘preserve and retain certain specified information for specific durations in a manner prescribed by the Central Government’. Any intermediary who intentionally or knowingly fails to retain such information shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine.","as amended by the <a href=""http://deity.gov.in/sites/upload_files/dit/files/downloads/itact2000/itbill2000.pdf"">Information Technology Act 2000</a>

The provisions dealt with content removal online and blocking orders. According to the Supreme Court, vague standards for blocking and removing content online are unconstitutional. Additionally, content blocking must be mandated only by a reasoned order from a judicial, administrative or governmental body and must be transparent.

(2) The case was brought before the Supreme Court by two young ladies arrested by the police for posting on a social networking site critical comments about a city shutdown. Actually, one of these two young women just reinforced the original comment by ""liking"" it.

(3) First, the Indian Supreme Court struck down provisions heavily censoring online speech through the implementation of amorphous and overbroad standards. Specifically, the Court declared Section 66A of the Information Technology Act as unconstitutional. Section 66A allowed both criminal charges against users and the removal of content by intermediaries based on allegations that the content was “grossly offensive or has menacing character”, or that false information was posted “for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will."" The Court noted that Section 66A did not qualify as a reasonable restriction on freedom of expression by being vaguely worded and allowing misuse by the police.

(4) Second, the Supreme Court construed Section 79 of the IT Act in such a manner that removal of content online may only occur if an adjudicatory body issues an order compelling intermediaries to remove the content. Section 79 of the IT Act provided that safe harbors from liability for online intermediaries could be suspended if the intermediary fails to take down content upon “receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit [an] unlawful act”. The Supreme Court interpretation of Section 79 shields intermediaries from liability unless they fail to comply with an order directing them to remove the illegal content, rather than merely a private party request.

(5) The judgment still maintains in place Section 69A of the IT act that provides the government with the ""power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource [ . . . ] [w]here the Central Government or any of its officers specially authorised by it in this behalf is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above.""

<div>(<strong>2</strong>) The case was brought before the Supreme Court by two young ladies arrested by the police for posting on a social networking site critical comments about a city shutdown. Actually, one of these two young women just reinforced the original comment by ""liking"" it.</div>
<div>(<strong>3</strong>) First, the Indian Supreme Court struck down provisions heavily censoring online speech through the implementation of amorphous and overbroad standards. Specifically, the Court declared Section 66A of the Information Technology Act as unconstitutional. Section 66A allowed both criminal charges against users and the removal of content by intermediaries based on allegations that the content was “grossly offensive or has menacing character”, or that false information was posted “for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will."" The Court noted that Section 66A did not qualify as a reasonable restriction on freedom of expression by being vaguely worded and allowing misuse by the police.</div>
<div>(<strong>4</strong>) Second, the Supreme Court construed Section 79 of the IT Act in such a manner that removal of content online may only occur if an adjudicatory body issues an order compelling intermediaries to remove the content. Section 79 of the IT Act provided that safe harbors from liability for online intermediaries could be suspended if the intermediary fails to take down content upon “receiving actual knowledge, or on being notified by the appropriate Government or its agency that any information, data or communication link residing in or connected to a computer resource controlled by the intermediary is being used to commit an unlawful act”. The Supreme Court interpretation of Section 79 shields intermediaries from liability unless they fail to comply with an order directing them to remove the illegal content, rather than merely a private party request.</div>
<div>(<strong>5</strong>) The judgment still maintains in place Section 69A of the IT act that provides the government with the ""power to issue directions for blocking for public access of any information through any computer resource  . . .  where the Central Government or any of its officers specially authorised by it in this behalf is satisfied that it is necessary or expedient so to do, in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above.""&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>6</strong>) Finally, the court stated that transparency standards should apply to blocking orders and all website blocking orders should be made public.

Baidu claimed that BaiduWenku was just a platform for Internet users to upload and share materials, and it had fulfill reasonable duty of care to prevent infringement on its platform, so it should not be held liable.

(2) The Beijing First Intermediate People’s Court held that Baidu was incapable of monitoring all uploads and did not directly benefit from infringement, but should know the infringing uploads in question.  According to the decision, the defendant Baidu kept the viewing and downloading data of each uploaded work. By using current technologies, it was reasonable for Baidu to execute a monitoring mechanism in light of which, once an uploaded work has been viewed or downloaded more than certain times, Baidu needs to inspect the potential copyright status of the work by contacting the uploader, checking whether the work is originally created by the uploader or legally authorized by the copyright owners. In this case, the plaintiff’s works had been viewed by a high volume of users. However, Baidu failed to exercise its duty to examine the legal status of the plaintiff’s works and should have known that the plaintiff’s works were illegally uploaded.

(3) On appeal, Beijing Higher People’s Court upheld the previous decision.  This case sets a duty for Internet hosting providers to protect popular works. Because once a copy of a popular work is uploaded on a platform, it tends to attract many views and downloads.

101,"Republic Act No. 10175 (a.k.a. the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012),  September 12, 2012","<div><strong><a href=""http://www.gov.ph/2012/09/12/republic-act-no-10175/"">Republic Act No. 10175</a> (a.k.a. the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012), &nbsp;September 12, 2012</strong></div>","(1) On Service Providers

(i) The law defines service provider as “any public or private entity that provides to users of its service the ability to communicate by means of a computer system” and “any other entity that processes or stores computer data on behalf of such communication service or users of such service” [Section 3(n)]. Other relevant terms defined by the law include “computer data”, “subscriber’s information”, and “traffic data"" [Section 3(e), (o) and (p)].

(ii) For law enforcement purposes, service providers are required to preserve computer data within a specified period. The mandatory retention period (6 months) may be extended pursuant to an order by a law enforcement authority (one-time extension for another 6 months) (Section 13).

(iii) Law enforcement authorities may thereafter compel the service provider to disclose such traffic data and subscriber information, as well as any other relevant data or information in its possession, pursuant to a court-issued warrant, within 72 hours from receipt of the order (Section 14).

(iv) To gain possession of and examine relevant computer data, law enforcement authorities also have the option of securing a search and seizure warrant, which may be then enforced against a computer user or service provider, as the case may be (Section 15).

(v) Once the mandatory data retention periods imposed by the law have expired, both service providers and law enforcement authorities are required to delete or destroy the computer data subject involved (Section 17).

(vi) A service provider’s failure to comply with an order issued by a law enforcement authority is punishable under the law. Section 20 is clear on this point:

""Noncompliance. — Failure to comply with the provisions of Chapter IV hereof specifically the orders from law enforcement authorities shall be punished as a violation of Presidential Decree No. 1829 with imprisonment of prision correctional in its maximum period or a fine of One hundred thousand pesos (Php100,000.00) or both, for each and every noncompliance with an order issued by law enforcement authorities."" (PD No. 1829, as referred to in the foregoing provision, refers to an old law penalizing acts constituting obstruction to the apprehension of suspects in a criminal investigation, or the prosecution of criminal offenses.)

(2) Miscellaneous Provisions

(i) To date, there is no available data to suggest if any of the punishable acts (i.e., illegal access, illegal interception, etc.) treated by the law as constituting cybercrimes may be held against a service provider or any intermediary liability. There is, however, one particular offense cited in the law that could pose the greatest challenge: “aiding or abetting in the commission of a cybercrime”. Section 5(a) reads: ""Aiding or Abetting in the Commission of Cybercrime. – Any person who willfully abets or aids in the commission of any of the offenses enumerated in this Act shall be held liable.""

(ii) If and when a service provider is held liable for any of the offenses prescribed by the law, a key provision—other than those prescribing the corresponding penalties—is that which accounts for corporate liability. In this wise, Section 9 is instructive:
""SEC. 9. Corporate Liability. — When any of the punishable acts herein defined are knowingly committed on behalf of or for the benefit of a juridical person, by a natural person acting either individually or as part of an organ of the juridical person, who has a leading position within, based on: (a) a power of representation of the juridical person provided the act committed falls within the scope of such authority; (b) an authority to take decisions on behalf of the juridical person: Provided, That the act committed falls within the scope of such authority; or (c) an authority to exercise control within the juridical person, the juridical person shall be held liable for a fine equivalent to at least double the fines imposable in Section 7 up to a maximum of Ten million pesos (PhP10,000,000.00).

If the commission of any of the punishable acts herein defined was made possible due to the lack of supervision or control by a natural person referred to and described in the preceding paragraph, for the benefit of that juridical person by a natural person acting under its authority, the juridical person shall be held liable for a fine equivalent to at least double the fines imposable in Section 7 up to a maximum of Five million pesos (PhP5,000,000.00).

The liability imposed on the juridical person shall be without prejudice to the criminal liability of the natural person who has committed the offense.""

 (i) Under the law, an internet content host is defined as any person who hosts or who proposes to host internet content in the Philippines [Section 3(f)]. Each one is bound to observe and perform certain specific duties, thus:
“Duties of an Internet Content Host. – An internet content host shall:
(a)   Not host any form of child pornography on its internet address;
(b)   Within seven (7) days, report the presence of any form of child pornography, as well as the particulars of the person maintaining, hosting, distributing or in any manner contributing to such internet address, to the proper authorities; and
(c)   Preserve such evidence for purposes of investigation and prosecution by relevant authorities.

An internet content host shall, upon the request of proper authorities, furnish the particulars of users who gained access to an internet address that contains any form of child pornography.
An internet content host who shall knowingly, willfully and intentionally violate this provision shall be subject to the penalty provided under Section 15(j) of this Act: Provided, That the failure of the internet content host to remove any form of child pornography is hitting its server shall be conclusive evidence of willful and intentional violation thereof.” (Section 11)

(ii) For this purpose, Section 15(j) reads:
“Any person found guilty of violating Section 11 of this Act shall suffer the penalty of prison correccional in its medium period and a fine of not less than one million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) but not more than two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) for the first offense. In the case of a subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine not less than Two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) but not more than Three million pesos (Php3,000,000.00) and revocation of its license to operate and immediate closure of the establishment;”

(2) On Internet Service Providers
 (i) On the other hand, an internet service provider (ISP) is defined as a “person or entity that supplies or proposes to supply, an internet carriage service to the public” [Section 3(g)]. Its duties under the law are, as follows:
“Duties of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). All internet service providers (ISPs) shall notify the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) within seven (7) days from obtaining facts and circumstances that any form of child pornography is being committed using its server or facility. Nothing in this section may be construed to require an ISP to engage in the monitoring of any user, subscriber or customer, or the content of any communication of any such person: Provided, That no ISP shall be held liable for damages on account of any notice given in good faith in compliance with this section.
Furthermore, an ISP shall preserve such evidence for purpose of investigation and prosecution by relevant authorities.
An ISP shall, upon the request of proper authorities, furnish the particulars of users who gained or attempted to gain access to an internet address which contains any form of child pornography.
All ISPs shall install available technology, program or software to ensure that access to or transmittal of any form of child pornography will be blocked or filtered.
An ISP who shall knowingly, willfully and intentionally violate this provision shall be subject to the penalty provided under Section 15(k) of this Act.
The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) shall promulgate within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Act the necessary rules and regulations for the implementation of this provision which shall include, among others, the installation of filtering software that will block access to or transmission of any form of the child pornography.” (Section 9)

(ii) Section 15(k) of the law reads:
“Any ISP found guilty of willfully and knowingly failing to comply with the notice and installation requirements under Section 9 of this Act shall suffer the penalty of a fine not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (Php500,000.00) but not more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) for the first offense. In case of subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine of not less than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) but not more than Two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) and revocation of its license to operate.”

(3) On Telecommunications Companies

(i) Inasmuch as some telecommunications companies already operate as ISPs, and may therefore be held liable as such under the applicable provisions of the law, there is nevertheless a separate provision directed specifically at such entities. Section 4(f) of the law declares:
“Unlawful or Prohibited Acts. – It shall be unlawful for any person:
(f) For film distributors, theaters and telecommunications companies, by themselves or in cooperation with other entities, to distribute any form of child pornography;”
(ii) The imposable penalty for such violation may be found in Section 15(c) of the law:
“Any person found guilty of violating Section (d), (e), and (f) of this Act shall suffer the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period and a fine of not less than seven hundred fifty thousand pesos (Php750,000.00) but not more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00);”
(iii) It is unclear how else telecommunications companies may be expected to distribute child pornography other than by operating as ISPs.
(4) Miscellaneous Provisions
(i) Where the offender involved is a juridical person, the penalty shall be imposed upon the “owner, partner, member of the board of directors and/or any responsible officer who participated in the commission of the crime or shall have knowingly permitted or failed to prevent its commissions” (Section 16).
(ii) The law also mandates the confiscation and forfeiture of equipment used in child pornography. However, it is unclear if and how this applies to intermediaries who are held liable for violating the provisions of the law (Section 17).
(iii) It is also worth noting that under Section 6 of the more recently enacted law of Republic Act No. 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012) (see above), the imposable penalty for crimes defined and made punishable by the Revised Penal Code or a special law like Republic Act No. 9775, shall be one (1) degree higher than that provided by the RPC or special law concerned, if committed “by, through and with the use of information and communications technologies”.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) <strong>On Internet Content Hosts</strong></div>

<div style=""margin-left:.25in;"">An internet content host who shall knowingly, willfully and intentionally violate this provision shall be subject to the penalty provided under Section 15(j) of this Act: Provided, That the failure of the internet content host to remove any form of child pornography is hitting its server shall be conclusive evidence of willful and intentional violation thereof.” (<strong>Section 11</strong>)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>ii</strong>) For this purpose, <strong>Section 15(j) </strong>reads:</div>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">“Any person found guilty of violating Section 11 of this Act shall suffer the penalty of prison correccional in its medium period and a fine of not less than one million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) but not more than two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) for the first offense. In the case of a subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine not less than Two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) but not more than Three million pesos (Php3,000,000.00) and revocation of its license to operate and immediate closure of the establishment;”</p>
</div>
<div>(<strong>2</strong>)<strong> On Internet Service Providers</strong></div>
<div>(<strong>i</strong>) On the other hand, an internet service provider (ISP) is defined as a “person or entity that supplies or proposes to supply, an internet carriage service to the public” <strong>Section 3(g)</strong>. Its <strong>duties</strong> under the law are, as follows:</div>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">“Duties of an Internet Service Provider (ISP). All internet service providers (ISPs) shall notify the Philippine National Police (PNP) or the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) within seven (7) days from obtaining facts and circumstances that any form of child pornography is being committed using its server or facility. Nothing in this section may be construed to require an ISP to engage in the monitoring of any user, subscriber or customer, or the content of any communication of any such person: Provided, That no ISP shall be held liable for damages on account of any notice given in good faith in compliance with this section.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Furthermore, an ISP shall preserve such evidence for purpose of investigation and prosecution by relevant authorities.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">An ISP shall, upon the request of proper authorities, furnish the particulars of users who gained or attempted to gain access to an internet address which contains any form of child pornography.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">All ISPs shall install available technology, program or software to ensure that access to or transmittal of any form of child pornography will be blocked or filtered.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">An ISP who shall knowingly, willfully and intentionally violate this provision shall be subject to the penalty provided under Section 15(k) of this Act.<strong style=""font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;"">&nbsp;</strong></p>
<div style=""margin-left:.25in;"">The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) shall promulgate within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Act the necessary rules and regulations for the implementation of this provision which shall include, among others, the installation of filtering software that will block access to or transmission of any form of the child pornography.” (<strong>Section 9</strong>)</div>
<div>(<strong>ii</strong>) <strong>Section 15(k)</strong> of the law reads:</div>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">“Any ISP found guilty of willfully and knowingly failing to comply with the notice and installation requirements under Section 9 of this Act shall suffer the penalty of a fine not less than Five hundred thousand pesos (Php500,000.00) but not more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) for the first offense. In case of subsequent offense, the penalty shall be a fine of not less than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00) but not more than Two million pesos (Php2,000,000.00) and revocation of its license to operate.”</p>
<div>(<strong>3</strong>) <strong>On Telecommunications Companies</strong></div>
<div>(<strong>i</strong>) Inasmuch as some telecommunications companies already operate as ISPs, and may therefore be held liable as such under the applicable provisions of the law, there is nevertheless a <strong>separate provision directed specifically at such entities</strong>. <strong>Section 4(f)</strong> of the law declares:<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">“Unlawful or Prohibited Acts. – It shall be unlawful for any person:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.5in;"">(<strong>f</strong>) For film distributors, theaters and telecommunications companies, by themselves or in cooperation with other entities, to distribute any form of child pornography;”</p>
<p>(<strong>ii</strong>) The imposable penalty for such violation may be found in <strong>Section 15(c)</strong> of the law:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">“Any person found guilty of violating Section (d), (e), and (f) of this Act shall suffer the penalty of reclusion temporal in its medium period and a fine of not less than seven hundred fifty thousand pesos (Php750,000.00) but not more than One million pesos (Php1,000,000.00);”</p>
<div>(<strong>iii</strong>) It is unclear how else telecommunications companies may be expected to distribute child pornography other than by operating as ISPs.</div>
<div>(<strong>4</strong>) <strong>Miscellaneous Provisions</strong></div>
<div>(<strong>i</strong>) Where the offender involved is a juridical person, the penalty shall be imposed upon the “owner, partner, member of the board of directors and/or any responsible officer who participated in the commission of the crime or shall have knowingly permitted or failed to prevent its commissions” (<strong>Section 16</strong>).</div>
<div>(<strong>ii</strong>) The law also mandates the confiscation and forfeiture of equipment used in child pornography. However, it is unclear if and how this applies to intermediaries who are held liable for violating the provisions of the law (<strong>Section 17</strong>).</div>
<div>(<strong>iii</strong>) It is also worth noting that under Section 6 of the more recently enacted law of Republic Act No. 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012) (see above), the imposable penalty for crimes defined and made punishable by the Revised Penal Code or a special law like Republic Act No. 9775, shall be one (1) degree higher than that provided by the RPC or special law concerned, if committed “by, through and with the use of information and communications technologies”.</div>",Philippines,,LEGISLATION - Law,2009,Legislation,Legislative Branch,Civil,Child Protection (Includes Child Pornography),Primary,Internet Access Provider (Including Mobile),Weakens Immunity,Takedowct Upon Knowledge (Includes Notice and Takedown),Storing/Hosting/Making Available at Platform (Include UGC),Monitor or Filter+Data Retention or Disclosure+Block or Remove,,Data,,,,,,,Broken,http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2009/ra_9775_2009.html,,

 The law defines an intermediary as “a person who in behalf of another person and with respect to a particular electronic document sends, receives, and/or stores, provides other services in respect of that electronic data message or electronic document”. [Sec. 5(h)] However, except where it excludes this person from the concepts of “addressee” [see: Section 5(a)] and “originator” [see: Section 5(i)], the law makes no mention the term anywhere else in its text.
 (2) On Service Providers
 (ii) A service provider, on the other hand, is defined by the law in the following manner:
“’Service Provider’ refers to a provider of:
i. online services or network access or the operator of facilities therefor including entities offering the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for online communications, digital or otherwise, between or among points specified by a user of electronic documents of the user’s choosing; or
ii. the necessary technical means by which electronic documents of an originator may be stored and made accessible to designated or undesignated third party.
Such service providers shall have no authority to modify or alter the content of the electronic document received or to make any entry therein on behalf of the originator, addressee or any third party unless specifically authorized to do so, and who shall retain the electronic document in accordance with the specific request or as necessary for the purpose of performing the services it was engaged to perform.” [Section 5(i)]
(ii) Unlike in the case of an intermediary, an entire section is devoted to delineating the extent of liability of a service provider as regards a particular electronic data message or electronic document. Thus, Section 30 reads:
“Extent of Liability of a Service Provider. – Except as otherwise provided in this Section, no person or party shall be subject to any civil or criminal liability in respect of the electronic data message or electronic document for which the person or party acting as a service provider as defined in Section 5, merely provides access if such liability is founded on –

(b) The making, publication, dissemination or distribution of such material or any statement made in such material, including possible infringement of any right subsisting in or in relation to such material. Provided, That
i. The service provider does not have actual knowledge, or is not aware of the facts or circumstances from which it is apparent, that the making, publication, dissemination or distribution of each material is unlawful or infringes any rights subsisting in or in relation to such material;
ii. The service provider does not knowingly receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the unlawful or infringing activity; and
iii. The service provider does not directly commit any infringement or other unlawful act and does not induce or cause another person or party to commit any infringement or other unlawful act and/or does not benefit financially from the infringing activity or unlawful act or another person or party; Provider, further, That nothing in this Section shall affect –
a. Any obligation founded on contract;
b. The obligation of a service provider as such under a licensing or other regulatory regime established under written law;
c. Any obligation imposed under any written law;
d.

Case, January 31, 2017","<div><strong style=""font-size: 13.008px;""><a href=""http://www.courts.go.jp/app/files/hanrei_jp/482/086482_hanrei.pdf"">Supreme Court (The Third Petty Bench), Heisei 28 (Kyo) No. 45 Google Inc. Case</a>, January 31, 2017.</strong></div>","[On January 31, 2017, the Supreme Court of Japan issued a decision on a case filed by an individual residing in Japan against Google Inc. in the United States, demanding the deletion of links in Google's search results to webpages that refer to the individual's crime committed in 2011.  The individual's demand was first examined by the Saitama District Court, which accepted the individual's claim specifically mentioning to the ""right to be forgotten,"" and issued an order for Google Inc. to delete the links.  Google Inc. appealed the case to the Tokyo High Court, which reversed the decision and dismissed the individual's claim.  The individual then appealed the case to the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court stated in its decision that the search result is not only an automatic and mechanical listing of information that simply intermediates third parties' website information, but also Google's own ""expression."" This means that the search result may constitute an infringement of another person's right to privacy, and Google Inc. as the party that expressed the information, may be liable for the infringement.  The Supreme Court, however, also averred that putting a restriction on search results may harm the search engine service provider's social role as an infrastructure service provider at present.  Based on this analysis, the Supreme Court concluded that whether providing links to websites that contain articles regarding someone's private information would constitute an illegal act must be determined considering several factors, including: (i) the nature and content of the information; (ii) the scope and magnitude of the effect when the information is spread; (iii) the individual's social status; (iv) the purpose and value of the article containing the information; (v) the social background at the time the article is publicized and subsequent changes; and (vi) the need to refer to the information in the article.  The Supreme Court concluded that a demand for the deletion of a link should be acknowledged only when the legal benefits gained by prohibiting the disclosure of the information obviously exceed the benefits that may be gained by providing the search results.

In this specific case, the Supreme Court dismissed the individual's demand for deletion, noting that the information concerning the individual's crime is still relevant to public concern because it was a child prostitution case that is still socially relevant. Therefore, the legal benefits from not disclosing the information does not obviously exceed the benefits that may be gained from allowing the search engine to accomplish its tasks unhindered.  The Supreme Court also noted that the scope of information spread is relatively limited because the search result only appears when a specific combination of words is used as the search term.

Before this Supreme Court decision was issued, some lower courts handled similar cases and some district courts issued orders to delete links to websites that may constitute an infringement of privacy.  For example, the Tokyo District Court accepted, in its decision of October 9, 2015, an individual's demand for Google. Inc. to delete links that contain statements suggesting that the individual committed a crime.  It was reported that Google actually deleted the links, according to the court order.

This Supreme Court decision is the first Supreme Court decision in Japan that dealt with a demand for the deletion of links to a website, filed against a search engine service provider.  Considering the criteria that the Supreme Court established ― the benefit from not disclosing the information ""obviously exceeds"" the benefit of providing information ― it may become difficult after this Supreme Court decision to demand that search engine service providers delete links to private information.]","<div><p>[On January 31, 2017, the Supreme Court of Japan issued a decision on a case filed by an individual residing in Japan against Google Inc. in the United States, demanding the deletion of links in Google's search results to webpages that refer to the individual's crime committed in 2011.&nbsp; The individual's demand was first examined by the Saitama District Court, which accepted the individual's claim specifically mentioning to the ""right to be forgotten,"" and issued an order for Google Inc. to delete the links.&nbsp; Google Inc. appealed the case to the Tokyo High Court, which reversed the decision and dismissed the individual's claim.&nbsp; The individual then appealed the case to the Supreme Court.</p>

Rakuten Ichiba is an Internet shopping mall where retailers can establish virtual stores.  Some of such virtual stores sold products that infringe the trademark rights of the trademark owner.

(2) Rakuten argued that (i) the seller of the infringing goods was each of the retailers who established a virtual store in Rakuten Ichiba, not Rakuten, and (ii) the role of Rakuten was merely to provide retailers with opportunity to make deals with customers.  In response, the trademark owner argued that, considering the involvement of Rakuten in the sale of the goods, Rakuten should be deemed to have sold the goods at least together with the retailer.

(3) The Intellectual Property High Court (""IP High Court"") ruled in favor of Rakuten stating as follows: ""An operator of web pages who, not only puts in place certain environment that enables retailers to establish web pages but also provides the operating systems, controls or manages establishment, maintenance and deletion of each virtual store, and obtains a benefit by requiring a store opening fee and a usage fee from the retailers, should be liable for infringement of trademark rights when it became aware of or there were reasonable grounds to find that the operator could become aware of the trademark infringement by the retailers; unless the operator deleted the web page constituting the infringement within a reasonable period after it became or could become aware of the infringement."" In this case, the IP High Court concluded that, since Rakuten deleted the web pages within a reasonable period -- eight days from the time Rakuten became aware of the trademark infringement -- Rakuten was not liable for trademark infringement. Although this is a trademark infringement case, the Supreme Court's discussion concerning the online store's liability for user's IP infringement would similarly apply to copyright infringement and intermediary liability.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) In this litigation, a trademark holder brought a trademark infringement litigation against Rakuten K.K., the operator of the online shopping mall named “Rakuten Ichiba”, claiming that Rakuten's operation of the online mall constituted an infringement of the plaintiff's trademark rights. &nbsp;Rakuten Ichiba is an Internet shopping mall where retailers can establish virtual stores. &nbsp;Some of such virtual stores sold products that infringe the trademark rights of the trademark owner.</div>

Actually, 96.7% of the music data exchanged by users using this service were illegal copies of music data.

(2) The Tokyo District stated that Japan MMO is liable for copyright infringement by users because (i) Japan MMO played an important role to collect and distribute information concerning users’ music data, (ii) it knew that most of the music data being exchanged by users were illegal copies that infringed copyright and (iii) did not take meaningful measures to delete infringing music data based on the “notice and takedown” procedure that Japan MMO claimed to have set up.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) With respect to a copyright infringement case involving Channel 2 where a user uploaded a small part of a copyrighted work onto the bulletin board, the Tokyo District Court held that Channel 2 only had a duty to remove works suspected of copyright infringement if it transmitted the infringing content or otherwise it was “obvious” the content infringed a third party’s copyright.

However, Part VIB ‘Limitation of Liabilities of the Service Provider’ Sections 43B-I, was added which provides a safe harbor provision for internet intermediary liability for copyright infringement. The provisions are similar to the DMCA in the US in which ISPs and content aggregators are provided immunity from liability for copyright infringement if they protect copyright owners by removing or disabling access to infringing content.

43B. Interpretation

A service provider is a person who provides services relating to, or provides connections for, the access, transmission or routing of data; or operates facilities for, online services or network access.

43C. Transmission, routing and provision of connections

(1) A service provider shall not be held liable for copyright infringement for the transmission or routing of or providing connections to an infringing work; or any transient storage thereof; under the following conditions: the transmission, routing, provision of connections or storage of the electronic copy of the infringing work was not initiated by the service provider; is carried out through an automatic technical process, does not make any modification, and does not select the recipient, except as an automatic response.

(2) The court may order the service provider to take reasonable steps to disable access to an online location that is physically situated outside Malaysia; or terminate a specified account.

43D. System caching

The service provider shall not be held liable for system caching.

43E. Storage and information location tools

(1) The service provider shall not be held liable for storing infringing work at the direction of a user of its primary network; or linking a user via a hyperlink, directory or search engine to an online location which makes an infringing work available. Under the condition that the service provider:

(i) does not have actual knowledge that the electronic copy of the work or activity is infringing; is not aware of the facts or circumstances from which the infringing activity is apparent, which is the red flag requirement (contributory liability);
(ii) that the service provider does not receive any financial benefit directly attributable to the infringement of the copyright and that the service provider does not have the right and ability to control the infringing activity (vicarious liability);
(iii) that upon receipt of a notification of any infringement, the service provider responds within the time specified to remove or disable access to the material. If no notification is given the service provider shall not be held liable.

(2) A test is given for vicarious liability, which includes taking into account any industry practice in relation to charging of services by a service provider.

43F. Exemption of service provider from liability for removal of copy or other activities from network

(1) The service provider is not liable for the removal or disabling of content in good faith, but he shall notify “as far as may be practicable” the person who made available the electronic copy and also show him the notification received from the copyright owner.

(2) If the person who made the copy available settled with the copyright owner or was adjudicated by any court or tribunal as the rightful copyright owner, the service provider shall “as far as practicable” restore the electronic copy to its primary network or restore access to the electronic

(3) If a service provider had solely provided a facility which was used by a person to infringe a copyrighted work he did not authorize the copyright infringement of copyright.

43G. Information on service provider

If the service provider would like to fall under the safe harbor provision he needs to make accessible his name and address and provide details and particulars of a designated agent to receive any complaint or notice regarding an allegation of infringement of copyright.

43H. Notification by copyright owner and its effect

(1) The copyright holder can notify the service provider to remove or disable any access to copyright infringing content, provided that the copyright owner shall compensate the service provider or any other person against any damages, loss or liability arising from the compliance by the service provider of such notification.

(2) The service provider shall remove or disable any access to work that is infringing copyright within 48 hours after he received the notification.

(3) The person whose electronic copy was removed or to which access has been disabled may issue to the service provider a counter notification, after which the service provider needs to restore the electronic copy or access to it, provided that the person shall undertake to compensate the service provider or any other person against any damages, loss or liability arising from the compliance by the service provider of such counter notification. A counter notification to the service provider’s designated agent should contain a statement under penalty of perjury that the issuer has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

Arising from its obligations under the U.S. Singapore Free Trade Agreement,  Singapore further revised in 2004 the safe harbor defenses in the Copyright Act for network service providers.

(1) Section 193A of the Copyright Act states that the safe harbor defenses are to apply to “network service providers”, which includes ISPs as intermediaries providing services and connections for data transmission or routing, as well as intermediaries who provide or operate facilities for online services or network access. It would seem that “network service providers” are broadly defined so that most Internet intermediaries would qualify for the safe harbor defenses. In the Singapore High Court decision in RecordTV Pte Ltd v. MediaCorp TV Singapore Pte Ltd, [2009] SGHC 287 (Sing. H.C.) (“RecordTV”), the Singapore High Court chose to interpret section 193A to apply only to “bona fide” network service providers.  The court did not explain what it meant by a “bona fide” network service provider, only that as RecordTV made copies of the rightholders’ programming, it was not considered one that is bona fide.  On appeal, the Court of Appeal, which reversed the High Court for holding RecordTV liable, did not discuss this judicial gloss placed on the safe harbor defense.

(2) The four safe harbor defenses mirror the same defenses in the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Section 193B, modeled after 17 U.S.C. § 512(a), indemnifies an ISP (as a subclass of a “network service provider”) from monetary relief for any copyright infringement that occurs by reason of the transmission, routing, provision of connections or transient storage by the ISP of an electronic copy of the material. To qualify for this defense, the transmission must be initiated by a person (other than the ISP), the transmission must be carried out without any selection of the material, the ISP must not select the recipients of the material except by way of an automatic response, and the ISP must not make any substantive modifications to the material during its transmission. In RecordTV, the Internet intermediary sought to bring itself under this safe harbor defense. This was rightly rejected by the court, because the operations of RecordTV could hardly be characterized as an “automatic technical process” of an ISP, although it would have been easier for the court to dismiss this defense simply on the grounds that RecordTV is not an ISP.

(3) Section 193C of the Singapore Copyright Act, modeled after 17 U.S.C. § 512(b), indemnifies a network service provider for making, through an automatic process, a cached copy of a work on its network from the originating network, in response to a user’s action, in order to facilitate efficient access to the material by its users. The conditions are that the network service provider will not make any substantive modifications to the content of the cached copy, and if it is furnished with a take-down notice, it is to expeditiously take reasonable steps to remove or disable access to the cached copy of the work on its network.  In addition, it has to satisfy other conditions that the Minister may prescribe, including conditions relating to access to the copy, the refreshing, reloading or updating of the cached copy and non-interference with any technology used by the originating network to obtain information about usage of the material.

(4) Section 193D of the Singapore Copyright Act, modeled after 17 U.S.C. § 512(c) and (d), indemnify a network service provider for providing hosting and referral services from monetary relief for any copyright infringement arising from its activities. To qualify for protection, a network service provider providing hosting services that involve storing an electronic copy of the infringing material on its work must not receive any direct financial benefit from the infringement, and has to designate a representative to receive the prescribed take-down notices.  Likewise, a network service provider providing referral or linking services must not receive any direct financial benefit from the infringement, and has to designate a representative to receive the prescribed take-down notices.  The hosting or referring network service provider will lose the indemnity if upon acquiring actual knowledge of such facts or circumstances “which would lead inevitably to the conclusion” of infringement, or is furnished with a prescribed take-down notice, it does not expeditiously take reasonable steps to remove or disable access to the infringing material.

(5) Notwithstanding the safe harbor conditions which a network service provider has to observe to qualify for indemnity, section 193A of the Copyright Act states that a network service provider is not obliged to monitor its service or affirmatively seeking facts to indicate infringing activity, or to gain access to, remove or disable access to any infringing material.  However, to qualify for the safe harbors, a network service provider has to adopt and reasonably implement a policy for termination of repeat offenders, and must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures for identification or protection of copyrighted material.","<div>[In 1999, Singapore made its first amendments to the Copyright Act to introduce various safe harbor defenses for Internet intermediaries as network service providers.

<div>(<strong>5</strong>)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the safe harbor conditions which a network service provider has to observe to qualify for indemnity, section 193A of the Copyright Act states that a network service provider is not obliged to monitor its service or affirmatively seeking facts to indicate infringing activity, or to gain access to, remove or disable access to any infringing material. &nbsp;However, to qualify for the safe harbors, a network service provider has to adopt and reasonably implement a policy for termination of repeat offenders, and must accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures for identification or protection of copyrighted material.</div>",Singapore,,LEGISLATION - Law,2006,Legislation,Legislative Branch,Civil,Copyright,,Internet Access Provider (Including Mobile)+Cache+Host (Including Social Networks),Strengthens Immunity,Takedowct Upon Knowledge (Includes Notice and Takedown),Transmitting/Routing/Providing Connections+Caching+Linking,Monitor or Filter+Block or Remove+Terminate Account,,Trigger for OSP Obligations+,Civilian Request (Notice - Excludes Court Order and Government/Administrative Order),Other- Terminate Repeat Offender,,,,,Broken,http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=CompId%3A6221a48b-54ab-44eb-b9e1-3b2ec5343be6;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DC%3Btype%3DactsAll,http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ae20124e1-6616-4dc5-865f-c83553293ed3%20Depth%3A0%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0,http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ae20124e1-6616-4dc5-865f-c83553293ed3%20Depth%3A0%20Status%3Ainforce;rec=0

The respondents' broadcasts were received by the appellant's roof-mounted antenna and routed to the appellant's recording computers. If a registered user requested a recording, the appellant's control software would instruct the system to record the said program. Once a recording was made and stored on the appellant's premises' computers, it was made available for viewing to the user who requested the recording on their computers or their TVs. At the end of 15 days after the date of recording, the recordings were deleted.

(2) In relation to its recording system, the appellant's system underwent three configuration changes. In phase 1, the system eliminated the duplication of copies and made only 1 recording despite multiple registered users' requests for the same program to be recorded. In phase 2, the system would make multiple copies of recordings based on multiple user requests for the same programming, but would switch to a single copy being made if system resources were insufficient. In phase 3, the system was reconfigured so that individual copies of the same programming were made for each requesting registered user. The changes were ostensibly made in response to the judgment of the 2nd Circuit in the Cartoon Network LP v CSC Holdings (the Cablevision case). (For purposes of these proceedings, only the appellant's system in relation to phase 1 and phase 2 were in issue.)

(3) The respondents' objected, contending that the use of iDVR infringed its copyright in its MediaCorp programming (broadcasts and films). When the defendant commenced groundless threats of infringement proceedings, the plaintiffs in turn counterclaimed for copyright infringement and sought injunctive relief.

(4) The High Court allowed the respondents' claim against the appellant for copyright infringement. The appellant appealed.

(5) The Court of Appeal reversed the High Court. It found that it was the registered users requesting the recording of the shows using the appellant's iDVR service rather than the appellant who copied the respondents' programming.

(6) The court also held that the appellant did not communicate the recorded shows to the public – it was the registered users who requested the recording of a particular show and the registered users who did so did not constitute ""the public"" for purposes of ss 83 and 84 of the Copyright Act.

(7) The court also held that there is no reason why the aggregate of private and individual communications made to each registered user should transform the nature of such communications into ""public"" communications. Each registered user could only access the particular show he had requested to be recorded, and not the entire library of recorded works made by the appellant.

(8) Finally, the court held that the appellant did not authorize the registered users to do any act comprised in the respondents' copyright in their programming. To determine if there is authorization liability, four authorization liability factors have to be considered and evaluated in their totality in the context of the factual matrix of each case: (a) whether the alleged authorizer had control over the means by which copyright infringement was committed and hence, a power to prevent such infringement, (b) the nature of the relationship (if any) between the alleged authorizer and the actual infringer, (c) whether the alleged authorizer took reasonable steps to prevent or avoid copyright infringement, and (d) whether the alleged authorizer had actual or constructive knowledge of the occurrence of copyright infringement or the likelihood of such infringement occurring. On the facts, (a) while the appellant did have the power to prevent potential infringement of the respondents' copyright in its programming by shutting down its iDVR service altogether, it was not necessary to take this drastic step as it had expressly stated in its terms of use that registered users could only use its service to record those shows which they could otherwise legally view and record, (b) while there was a commercial relationship between the appellant and its users, on the evidence, the appellant did not benefit commercially, although the users benefited socially, and there was nothing wrong if the appellant profited from providing its service, (c) the appellant streamed its recorded shows to the users, rather than allowing its users to download them, thereby preventing illegal distribution, and provided in its terms that the recording was only to be used for personal, private and domestic use and only for those shows which a registered user could otherwise legally view and record, meaning that only those registered users in Singapore who held valid TV licenses could use the appellant's iDVR to record the respondents' shows, and not those out of jurisdiction, and (d) given the precautions taken, in absence of express proof of knowledge, it was not right to attribute knowledge of improper usage to the appellant.  For all these reasons, the court held that the appellant was not liable for authorizing the doing of any act comprised in the respondents' copyright in its programming.

Pacific Internet Ltd.,&nbsp;[2008] SGHC 35, [2008] 3 SLR 18,&nbsp;March 22, 2001</strong></div>","(1) Odex was a private company that provided Japanese anime programs to local television stations for broadcasting. It also distributed authorized copies of these programs to retailers for sale to the public. Odex alleged that with Internet piracy and the ease of obtaining DVD-quality movie files for free via P2P software, its sales of anime video titles had begun to drop significantly and that TV stations also bought fewer anime titles as they were allegedly losing viewership to illegal downloaders.

(2) To address this problem, Odex engaged the services of BayTSP.com Incorporated (BayTSP), an American company, to collect and track instances of unauthorized uploading and downloading of copies of Japanese anime video titles. Through BayTSP, Odex discovered that there had been more than 474,000 unique downloads over an 11-month period, based on searches conducted on only 50 out of more than 400 authorized titles. In these circumstances, Odex applied under Order 24 Rule 6(5) of the Singapore Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) for the pre-action discovery of documents from various local Internet service providers, to identify the illegal downloaders, based on 981 selected IP addresses of Internet users who were recorded as having carried out the highest instances of such uploading and downloading via the BitTorrent protocol. The defendant Pacific Internet, a local Internet service provider, resisted that application.

(3) Odex’s application for a discovery order failed before the District Court, which held that Odex did not have the locus standi to make the application, since it was only a sub-licensee for most of the video titles (whose infringement Odex complained of). For one title for which Odex was held to be the exclusive licensee (“Mobile Suit Gundam Seed”), the District Court was of the view that Odex had to show an extremely song prima facie case of wrongdoing before the order sought would be made in its favour. As Odex had failed to establish such a case, its application was dismissed.

(4) Odex appealed.

(5) The High Court rejected Odex’s argument that it had the requisite locus standi to apply for a discovery order, in reliance on the Practice Direction 4 of 2005 (“Applications for discovery or interrogatories against network service providers in relation to specific intellectual property issues”) and the Singapore Copyright (Network Service Provider) Regulations 2005 (S 220/2005). Odex had argued that both the Practice Direction and the Regulations refer to an application made “on behalf of a copyright owner”, and in doing so, sanctioned its application as a licensee. The court observed that the Practice Direction did not have the force of substantive law, and that Regulation 3(2)(b) did not pertain to discovery applications. The court also noted that the Singapore Copyright Act did not have an equivalent provision to 17 U.S.C. § 512(h)(1), which would enable a copyright owner or “a person authorised to act on the owner’s behalf” to issue a subpoena to a service provider for identifying an alleged infringer.

(6) The court held that an agent of a copyright owner or an exclusive licensee could not apply in the agent’s own name for pre-action discovery in order to identify infringers. While the copyright owners could use the services of an agent to track down infringers, they had to use their own names to commence civil court proceedings, apply for pre-action discovery and take formal action for substantive relief. Even if Odex were not relying on Order 24 Rule 6(1) for a discovery order but on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to issue a Norwich Pharmacal discovery order, it still had no locus standi to invoke the court’s jurisdiction. Nor could Odex merely claim that it would only use the information to initiate criminal proceedings because as a mere agent, it could not claim to be the right party entitled to relief.

(7) The court reversed the District Court on the requirement for an extremely strong prima facie case of wrongdoing, holding that the court below had prescribed too high a standard of proof. Where there was evidence of wrongdoing, the court would consider the strength of the case by the applicant for discovery order as one of the factors to be considered in the totality of the facts before deciding whether to grant the order in the interest of justice.

(8) Nonetheless, the court concluded that it was inexpedient to have the copyright owners start the discovery application all over, especially where on the current appeal, there was an application by some copyright owners to be added as plaintiffs. The court allowed these owners to be added as plaintiffs and allowed disclosure of the subscribers’ information to these plaintiffs as copyright owners for their respective video titles.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) Odex was a private company that provided Japanese anime programs to local television stations for broadcasting.

Even if Odex were not relying on Order 24 Rule 6(1) for a discovery order but on the inherent jurisdiction of the court to issue a Norwich Pharmacal discovery order, it still had no locus standi to invoke the court’s jurisdiction. Nor could Odex merely claim that it would only use the information to initiate criminal proceedings because as a mere agent, it could not claim to be the right party entitled to relief.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">7</strong>) The court reversed the District Court on the requirement for an extremely strong prima facie case of wrongdoing, holding that the court below had prescribed too high a standard of proof.

<div>(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">8</strong>) Nonetheless, the court concluded that it was inexpedient to have the copyright owners start the discovery application all over, especially where on the current appeal, there was an application by some copyright owners to be added as plaintiffs. The court allowed these owners to be added as plaintiffs and allowed disclosure of the subscribers’ information to these plaintiffs as copyright owners for their respective video titles.]</div>","<div>(<strong>1</strong>) Odex was a private company that provided Japanese anime programs to local television stations for broadcasting. It also distributed authorized copies of these programs to retailers for sale to the public. Odex alleged that with Internet piracy and the ease of obtaining DVD-quality movie files for free via P2P software, its sales of anime video titles had begun to drop significantly and that TV stations also bought fewer anime titles as they were allegedly losing viewership to illegal downloaders.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">2</strong>) To address this problem, Odex engaged the services of BayTSP.com Incorporated (BayTSP), an American company, to collect and track instances of unauthorized uploading and downloading of copies of Japanese anime video titles. Through BayTSP, Odex discovered that there had been more than 474,000 unique downloads over an 11-month period, based on searches conducted on only 50 out of more than 400 authorized titles. In these circumstances, Odex applied under Order 24 Rule 6(5) of the Singapore Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) for the pre-action discovery of documents from various local Internet service providers, to identify the illegal downloaders, based on 981 selected IP addresses of Internet users who were recorded as having carried out the highest instances of such uploading and downloading via the BitTorrent protocol. The defendant Pacific Internet, a local Internet service provider, resisted that application.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">3</strong>) Odex’s application for a discovery order failed before the District Court, which held that Odex did not have the locus standi to make the application, since it was only a sub-licensee for most of the video titles (whose infringement Odex complained of). For one title for which Odex was held to be the exclusive licensee (“Mobile Suit Gundam Seed”), the District Court was of the view that Odex had to show an extremely song prima facie case of wrongdoing before the order sought would be made in its favour. As Odex had failed to establish such a case, its application was dismissed.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">4</strong>) Odex appealed.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">5</strong>) The High Court rejected Odex’s argument that it had the requisite locus standi to apply for a discovery order, in reliance on the Practice Direction 4 of 2005 (“Applications for discovery or interrogatories against network service providers in relation to specific intellectual property issues”) and the Singapore Copyright (Network Service Provider) Regulations 2005 (S 220/2005). Odex had argued that both the Practice Direction and the Regulations refer to an application made “on behalf of a copyright owner”, and in doing so, sanctioned its application as a licensee. The court observed that the Practice Direction did not have the force of substantive law, and that Regulation 3(2)(b) did not pertain to discovery applications. The court also noted that the Singapore Copyright Act did not have an equivalent provision to 17 U.S.C. § 512(h)(1), which would enable a copyright owner or “a person authorised to act on the owner’s behalf” to issue a subpoena to a service provider for identifying an alleged infringer.&nbsp;</div>

130,"Copyright Act, as amended on January 22, 2014","<div><strong><a href=""http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=J0070017"">Copyright Act</a>, as amended on January 22, 2014</strong></div>","(1) Intermediary Liability of Copyright Infringement. The inducement liability of copyright infringement was enacted in 2007 under the influence of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, MGM v. Grokster, 545 U.S. 913 (2005). However, there is a critical difference between them with regard to the requirement of the resulting acts of infringement by a third party. In Grokster, the court holds that “one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties.” However, according to the subparagraph 7 of paragraph 1, article 87 of Taiwan’s Copyright Act, the intermediary’s behavior of enabling copyright infringement itself can be deemed an infringement of copyright under certain circumstances. In other words, a resulting act of copyright infringement by a third party is not a required element of the inducement liability in Taiwan’s Copyright Act. The view is supported by the legislative document of the enactment, which states that the amendment is to prohibit the behavior of inducing copyright infringement.

Article 87. Any of the following circumstances, except as otherwise provided under this Act, shall be deemed an infringement of copyright or plate rights: [ . . . ] 7. To provide to the public computer programs or other technology that can be used to publicly transmit or reproduce works, with the intent to allow the public to infringe economic rights by means of public transmission or reproduction by means of the Internet of the works of another, without the consent of or a license from the economic rights holder, and to receive benefit therefrom. A person who undertakes the actions set out in subparagraph 7 above shall be deemed to have ""intent"" pursuant to that subparagraph when the advertising or other active measures employed by the person instigates, solicits, incites, or persuades the public to use the computer program or other technology provided by that person for the purpose of infringing upon the economic rights of others.
Article 91 to  93 provide the relevant penalties for copyright infringement. In particular, Article 93 states that a sentence of up to two years imprisonment or detention shall be imposed, or in lieu thereof or in addition thereto, a fine of not more than five hundred thousand New Taiwan Dollars for the violation of subparagraph 7 of paragraph 1 of Article 87.

(2) Limitations on Civil Liability for Internet Service Providers (ChapterVI-1). The limitations on civil liability for Internet service providers were enacted during 2009 in Taiwan. They largely follow the framework of section 512 of DMCA. The internet service providers are divided into four categories -- connection service providers, caching service providers, information storage service providers, and search service providers – with different conditions of eligibility of limitation on liability.

Article 90-5. A connection service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if— 1. the transmission of the information was initiated by or at the request of the user; and 2. the transmission, routing, provision of connections, or storage is carried out through an automatic technical process, without any selection of the material or modification of its content by the connection service provider.
Article 90-6. A caching service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if— 1. the service provider does not make any modification to the cached information; 2. when the person who made the original information available subsequently update, deletes, or blocks access to it, the cached information is done in the same way as a result of an automatic technical process; and 3. the service provider responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information upon notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of the alleged infringement by the user of the service provider.
Article 90-7. An information storage service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if the service provider— 1. does not have knowledge of the allegedly infringing activity of the user; 2. does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity of the user; and 3. responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information upon notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of the alleged infringement by the user of the service provider.
Article 90-8. A search service provider shall not be liable for damages for infringement of the copyright or plate rights of another by a user of its service if the service provider— 1. does not have knowledge that the searched or linked information may be infringing; 2. does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity of the user; and 3. responds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information upon notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of the alleged infringement by the user of the service provider.

In addition, all the internet service providers need to meet the requirements of article 90-4 in order to be eligible for the limitations on liability.

Article 90-4. An Internet service provider shall be entitled to the application of Article 90sexies to Article 90novies regarding the limitation on liability only if the service provider— 1. by contract, electronic transmission, automatic detective system or other means, informs users of its copyright or plate right protection policy, and takes concrete action to implement it; and 2. by contract, electronic transmission, automatic detective system or other means, informs users that in the event of repeat alleged infringements up to three times the service provider shall terminate the service in whole or in part; and 3. publicly announces information regarding its contact window for receipt of notification documents. 4. accommodate and implement the technical measure described in paragraph 3. A connection service provider that, after receiving notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of alleged infringement by a user, has forwarded the notification to that particular user by electronic mail is deemed to have met the requirement in the preceding paragraph, subparagraph 1. If a copyright holder or plate rights holder has provided technical measures which have been developed based on a broad consensus and are used to identify or protect copyrighted or plate-righted works, the Internet service provider shall accommodate and implement the measures if the technical measures has been ratified by the competent authority.

With respect to information storage service providers, there are provisions for notice and takedown (Article 90-10).

Article 90-9. An information storage service provider shall forward notice to the allegedly infringing user of any measures taken under Article 90octies, subparagraph 3, by the contact method stipulated between the service provider and the user or by the contact information left by the user. However, this requirement shall not apply if the nature of the service provided makes such notice impossible. If a user referred to in the preceding paragraph believes that the materials were not involved in infringement, the user may submit counter notification documents to the information storage service provider with a request to restore the removed content or related information or restore the access to it. Upon receipt of a counter notification described in the preceding paragraph, an information storage service provider shall expeditiously forward such documents to the copyright holder or plate rights holder. If, within 10 business days since one day after the date of receiving counter notification from the information storage service provider as described in the preceding paragraph, the copyright holder or plate rights holder provides the information storage service provider with evidence regarding filing civil or criminal litigation against the user, the information storage service provider shall not bear any obligation to restore the content or related information. If the copyright holder or plate rights holder fails to provide evidence on filing litigation in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the information storage service provider shall, within no more than 14 business days since one day after the date of forwarding the counter-notification documents, restore the removed content or related information or restore the access to it. However, if restoration is impossible, the service provider shall notify the user in advance, or provide another appropriate method by which the user may restore it.
Article 90-10. An Internet service provider shall not be liable for damages to the allegedly infringing user if the service provider— 1. removes, or disables access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information in accordance with Articles 90septies to 90novies; or 2. upon obtaining knowledge of suspected infringement by the user, acts in good faith belief to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information.
Article 90-11. A person who misrepresents an Internet service provider with a notification or counter notification out of intention or negligence shall be liable for damages for any injury incurred on the user, copyright holder, plate right holder or Internet Service Provider.
Article 90-12. The information in connection with the public announcement of the contact window under Article 90quinquies, and the content of the notification and counter notification, required particulars, supplementation or correction, and other requisite matters under Articles 90septies through 90decies shall be prescribe by the competent authority.

Because the amendment in 2009 only refers to the limitations on civil liability for Internet service providers in its title, it is not clear the limitation also applies to criminal liability. The question is very important in the context of Taiwan since most copyright cases in Taiwan are litigated through criminal proceedings. Currently, according to the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office, the limitation also applies to criminal liability because it deems that once an intermediary follow the notice and takedown procedure, it has no intention in infringing copyright and hence cannot be convicted of infringing copyright.]

(3) Three-strikes Law. Article 90-4(2) (see above), the so-called three-strikes law, stipulates that an Internet service provider is entitled to limitation on civil liability only if it informs users that in the event of repeated alleged infringement up to three times, it shall terminate the service. However, unlike paragraph 1, which requires Internet service providers “to take concrete action to implement it,” paragraph 3 has no equivalent requirement. Arguably, an Internet service provider may be entitled to the limitation on liability simply by informing users of the consequence of repeated alleged infringements—by contract, electronic transmission or other means—without actually terminating the service.]  ","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>)&nbsp;<strong>Intermediary Liability of Copyright Infringement</strong>.&nbsp;The inducement liability of copyright infringement was enacted in 2007 under the influence of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision, MGM v.

<ul><li><strong>Article 90-4</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>An Internet service provider shall be entitled to the application of Article 90sexies to Article 90novies regarding the limitation on liability only if the service provider—&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>. by contract, electronic transmission, automatic detective system or other means, informs users of its copyright or plate right protection policy, and takes concrete action to implement it; and&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>. by contract, electronic transmission, automatic detective system or other means, informs users that in the event of repeat alleged infringements up to three times the service provider shall terminate the service in whole or in part; and&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>. publicly announces information regarding its contact window for receipt of notification documents.&nbsp;<strong>4</strong>. accommodate and implement the technical measure described in paragraph&nbsp;<strong>3</strong>.&nbsp;A connection service provider that, after receiving notification by a copyright holder or plate rights holder of alleged infringement by a user, has forwarded the notification to that particular user by electronic mail is deemed to have met the requirement in the preceding paragraph, subparagraph 1.&nbsp;If a copyright holder or plate rights holder has provided technical measures which have been developed based on a broad consensus and are used to identify or protect copyrighted or plate-righted works, the Internet service provider shall accommodate and implement the measures if the technical measures has been ratified by the competent authority.</li>
</ul>
<div>With respect to information storage service providers, there are provisions for notice and takedown (Article 90-10).</div>
<ul><li><strong>Article 90-9</strong>.&nbsp;An information storage service provider shall forward notice to the allegedly infringing user of any measures taken under Article 90octies, subparagraph 3, by the contact method stipulated between the service provider and the user or by the contact information left by the user. However, this requirement shall not apply if the nature of the service provided makes such notice impossible.&nbsp;If a user referred to in the preceding paragraph believes that the materials were not involved in infringement, the user may submit counter notification documents to the information storage service provider with a request to restore the removed content or related information or restore the access to it.&nbsp;Upon receipt of a counter notification described in the preceding paragraph, an information storage service provider shall expeditiously forward such documents to the copyright holder or plate rights holder.&nbsp;If, within 10 business days since one day after the date of receiving counter notification from the information storage service provider as described in the preceding paragraph, the copyright holder or plate rights holder provides the information storage service provider with evidence regarding filing civil or criminal litigation against the user, the information storage service provider shall not bear any obligation to restore the content or related information.&nbsp;If the copyright holder or plate rights holder fails to provide evidence on filing litigation in accordance with the preceding paragraph, the information storage service provider shall, within no more than 14 business days since one day after the date of forwarding the counter-notification documents, restore the removed content or related information or restore the access to it. However, if restoration is impossible, the service provider shall notify the user in advance, or provide another appropriate method by which the user may restore it.</li>
<li><strong>Article 90-10</strong>.&nbsp;An Internet service provider shall not be liable for damages to the allegedly infringing user if the service provider—&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>. removes, or disables access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information in accordance with Articles 90septies to 90novies; or&nbsp;<strong>2</strong>. upon obtaining knowledge of suspected infringement by the user, acts in good faith belief to remove, or disable access to, the allegedly infringing content or related information.</li>
<li><strong>Article 90-11</strong>.&nbsp;A person who misrepresents an Internet service provider with a notification or counter notification out of intention or negligence shall be liable for damages for any injury incurred on the user, copyright holder, plate right holder or Internet Service Provider.</li>
<li><strong>Article 90-12</strong>.&nbsp;The information in connection with the public announcement of the contact window under Article 90quinquies, and the content of the notification and counter notification, required particulars, supplementation or correction, and other requisite matters under Articles 90septies through 90decies shall be prescribe by the competent authority.</li>
</ul>
<div>Because the amendment in 2009 only refers to the limitations on civil liability for Internet service providers in its title, it is not clear the limitation also applies to criminal liability. The question is very important in the context of Taiwan since most copyright cases in Taiwan are litigated through criminal proceedings. Currently, according to the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office, the limitation also applies to criminal liability because it deems that once an intermediary follow the notice and takedown procedure, it has no intention in infringing copyright and hence cannot be convicted of infringing copyright.</div>
<div>(<strong>3</strong>) <strong>Three-strikes Law</strong>.&nbsp;Article 90-4(2) (see above), the so-called three-strikes law, stipulates that an Internet service provider is entitled to limitation on civil liability only if it informs users that in the event of repeated alleged infringement up to three times, it shall terminate the service. However, unlike paragraph 1, which requires Internet service providers “to take concrete action to implement it,” paragraph 3 has no equivalent requirement. Arguably, an Internet service provider may be entitled to the limitation on liability simply by informing users of the consequence of repeated alleged infringements—by contract, electronic transmission or other means—without actually terminating the service. &nbsp;</div>",Taiwan,,LEGISLATION - Law,2014,Legislation,Legislative Branch,Civil,Copyright,Secondary,General or Non-Specified+Internet Access Provider (Including Mobile)+Cache+Host (Including Social Networks),Mixed/Neutral/Unclear,Takedowct Upon Knowledge (Includes Notice and Takedown),Storing/Hosting/Making Available at Platform (Include UGC)+Caching+Organizing+Search,Block or Remove,,Procedural Protections for Users and Publishers,, ,Other,,,,Good/No Action Required,http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=J0070017,,http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=J0070017

The provision was amended twice in 2011 first to reflect the Korea-EU FTA and then the Korea-US FTA. EU Directive 2000/31/EC Section 4 “Liability of intermediary service providers” was almost exactly reproduced verbatim in the Intellectual Property chapter of the Korea-EU FTA, and the intellectual property chapter of the Korea-US FTA adopted the structure of DMCA safe harbor provisions. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the structure of Article 102 is very similar to that of EU Directive 2000/31/EC and DMCA. Paragraph (1) sets out specific conditions necessary for safe harbor for different types of Online Service Providers (OSPs). It classifies OSPs into four classes: mere conduits (subparagraph 1), caching (subparagraph 2), hosting (subparagraph 3), and information location tools (subparagraph 4). Paragraph (2) provides another safe harbor, stating that where it is technologically impossible for an OSP to take measures under paragraph (1), the OSP shall not be held liable. However, the court rarely, if ever, accepted a defense based on the provision. Paragraph (3) announces that OSPs do not have any general obligation to monitor. In spite of the provisions, there is much criticism on the court’s rigidness and lack of reasoning in application of safe harbors for intermediaries (see below). It seems the courts do not clearly discern elements of copyright infringement and conditions for enjoying safe harbors. That is, the courts tend to hold intermediaries liable if they do not meet the safe harbor >conditions instead of engaging in an independent analysis of liability.

(2) Article 103 sets out a notice and takedown system partially similar to DMCA. If a person claims copyright infringement and demands an OSP to suspend the reproduction or transmission of the works, the OSP should immediately comply and inform the claimant and the alleged infringer of such suspension. The reproducer or transmitter may request restoration by showing that acsuch reproduction or transmission was lawful. The OSP will be exempt from liabilities arising from the claimed copyright infringement by complying with the procedure in Article 103. Before the Copyright Act amendment in 2011, the OSP “may” be exempted or get its liability reduced. “Reproduction and transmission” is the term of art used by the legislators to describe the act of making material available online for downloading. The crucial difference with DMCA is that Korean copyright law requires on-demand takedown not as a requirement for qualifying for the safe harbor but as an unconditional requirement. The OSP cannot choose to deviate from the notice and takedown procedure.

(3) According to Article 103-3, a right holder may request an OSP for information necessary to take civil or criminal legal action against an alleged infringer such as the infringer’s name and address. When the OSP refuses, the person may request the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism to issue an order to the OSP. If the OSP does not comply with the Minister’s order to provide the information, the OSP will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 10 million won under Article 142(2)1. This was newly introduced to the Copyright Act in 2011.

(4) Article 104 is a unique provision to regulate special types of OSPs – mainly P2P and web-hard (cyber-lockers) service providers . It is unique and unprecedented in that it imposes direct obligation on the OSPs to implement the necessary measures for filtering out unlawful material. When there is a request by a right holder, those special types of OSPs must implement measures including filtering. The Enforcement Decree of the Copyright Act defines those necessary measures as:
Technical measures capable of identifying the work, etc. by comparing the title, characteristics of work, etc. (basically, a filtering measure mainly based on the titles and hash values of the works)
Measures of limiting search or transmission to cut off illegal forwarding of work, etc. that came to be recognized pursuant to subparagraph 1 (basically, a keyword based measure that prevents searching of the keywords and uploading of files including the keywords);
Where the illegal forwarder of the relevant work, etc. is identifiable, the dispatch of warning sign wording to the forwarder of the work, etc. requesting for the prohibition of infringement on the copyright.
Any OSP failing to implement such measures will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 30 million won under Article 142(1). Moreover, the OSP may be subject to cancellation or suspension of its business registration under the Telecommunications Business Act (see below). The court has been very strict in allowing the safe harbor of Article 102 to those special types of OSPs (see below). Constitutional complaint was raised, but the Constitutional Court found the provision constitutional (see below).

(5) In 2009, the Copyright Act introduced the notorious three-strike (or gradual response) regime. Article 133-2 and 133-3 prescribe a system where a subscriber, or an online bulletin board, which received more than three warnings is subject to suspension of its account up to six months. The suspension orders to OSPs are made by the Minister of Culture, Sports and tourism, which is an administrative agency. Those failing to abide by the provision – intermediaries - will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 10 million won under Article 142(2)4 and 5. This provision is on the brink of infringing on constitutional rights of the citizens as it may amount to an administrative censorship where no court review is involved.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>)&nbsp;<strong>Article 102</strong>&nbsp;provides&nbsp;<strong>safe harbor for intermediaries</strong>&nbsp;from third party copyright infringement.

It is unique and unprecedented in that it imposes direct obligation on the OSPs to implement the&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;measures&nbsp;for filtering out unlawful material. When there is a request by a right holder, those special types of OSPs must implement measures including filtering.&nbsp;The <strong>Enforcement Decree of the Copyright Act </strong>defines those necessary measures as:&nbsp;</div>

</ol>
<div>Any&nbsp;OSP failing to implement such measures will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 30 million won under Article 142(1). Moreover, the OSP may be subject to cancellation or suspension of its business registration under the Telecommunications Business Act (see below).

Those failing to abide by the provision – intermediaries - will be imposed of a civil fine not exceeding 10 million won under Article 142(2)4 and 5.

The provision was amended twice in 2011 first to reflect the Korea-EU FTA and then the Korea-US FTA. EU Directive 2000/31/EC Section 4 “Liability of intermediary service providers” was almost exactly reproduced verbatim in the Intellectual Property chapter of the Korea-EU FTA, and the intellectual property chapter of the Korea-US FTA adopted the structure of DMCA safe harbor provisions. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the structure of Article 102 is very similar to that of EU Directive 2000/31/EC and DMCA. <strong>Paragraph</strong> (<strong>1</strong>) sets out specific conditions necessary for safe harbor for different types of Online Service Providers (OSPs). It classifies OSPs into four classes: mere conduits (subparagraph 1), caching (subparagraph 2), hosting (subparagraph 3), and information location tools (subparagraph 4). Paragraph (<strong>2</strong>) provides another safe harbor, stating that where it is technologically impossible for an OSP to take measures under paragraph (1), the OSP shall not be held liable. However, the court rarely, if ever, accepted a defense based on the provision. Paragraph (<strong>3</strong>) announces that OSPs do not have any general obligation to monitor. In spite of the provisions, there is much criticism on the court’s rigidness and lack of reasoning in application of safe harbors for intermediaries (see below). It seems the courts do not clearly discern elements of copyright infringement and conditions for enjoying safe harbors. That is, the courts tend to hold intermediaries liable if they do not meet the&nbsp;safe harbor&nbsp;&gt;conditions instead of engaging in an independent analysis of liability.</div>

Online service providers of special type under Article 104 of the Copyright Act shall indicate words of warning, as prescribed by Presidential Decree, on the relevant screen or transmission program, clearly stating that a person who produces, distributes or possesses any child or juvenile pornography may be subject to punishment where their users search, upload or download the works stored at their computers, etc. (OSPs in violation of Article 17(2) will be punished by a civil fine not exceeding 30 million won according to Article 67(1).)

Always unsure of whether the information is rights-infringing or not, the provision has incentivized the service provider into erring on the side of deleting, often by deleting lawful information.

On top of that, Paragraph (4) states that “if a dispute resolution is anticipated or if the service provider is not sure of the rights-infringing nature of the information”, it “may” take a temporary measure instead of a permanent measure. According to a Constitutional Court in 2012 (2010Hun-ma88), the total effect of these provisions means that the takedown obligation arises not just when the information is infringing another’s rights but whenever a supposed victim requests takedown with certification to that effect.  In other words, when the unlawfulness of the information is in doubt as in Article 44-2(4), the service provider “may” take a less drastic, temporary measure but that is the minimum it must do whenever there is such request. Yet, the Constitutional Court found such provisions constitutional, citing the amplified danger of speech going online.  Moreover, there is no procedure to request restoration of deleted or blocked information available to the poster, unlike the U.S.’ DMCA or the current Copyright Act of the country.

Adidas alleged that eBay has a duty under Article 44(2) of ICNA (note: This provision declaratively states the service provider’s duty to make efforts to reduce rights-violating material on its services, and is not to be confused with Article 44-2 that imposes on-demand takedown obligations.) to prevent circulation of counterfeits and demanded eBay to take several measures including authenticity check of goods and counterfeit monitoring and filtering system.

(2) The Supreme Court held web portal sites Naver, Daum, SK Communications, and Yahoo Korea liable for the defamation of the plaintiff whom the user postings there accused of deserting a girlfriend upon the second pregnancy after he talked her into aborting the first where the girlfriend then committed a suicide. The court upheld judgments of 10 million won, 7 million won, 8 million won, and 5 million won, respectively, against these services.

(3) Specifically, the court held that, barring special circumstances, (a) the intermediary shall be liable for illegal contents to the same extent as a news agency and therefore shall be liable when (1) the illegality of the content is clear; (2) the provider was aware of the content; and (3) it is technically and financially possible to control the contents. (b) On top of the duty to take down such contents immediately, the intermediary has a duty to block similar postings later on. (c) The Court will find the provider’s requisite awareness under (2) above:

when the victim has requested specifically and individually for the takedown of the content;
when, even without such request, the provider was concretely aware of how and why the content was posted OR
when, even without request, it was apparently clear that the provider could have been aware of that content.

(4) The end result is that the intermediary will be absolutely liable for a posting later found to be “clearly” defamatory if “it was apparently clear that the provider could have been aware of that content” even if the victim did not notify the intermediary of the existence of the content.

On its face, Cl 91(1) appears to provide a strong immunity similar in effect to Section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act. The Federal clause renders any State or Territory legislation and any rule of common law or equity invalid to the extent that it: subjects internet hosts or ISPs to criminal or civil liability for hosting or transmitting content where the host is not aware of the nature of the content; or requires an internet host or ISP to monitor, make inquiries about, or keep records of, content hosted or transmitted.

The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft, now the Australian Screen Association, organised a lawsuit brought by 34 movie and television studios, alleging that iiNet was liable by failing to act upon notices alleging that users were infringing their copyrights. The court found that iiNet’s power to contractually terminate the internet accounts of infringing users was only an indirect power to prevent the primary infringements and insufficient to ground liability. Termination would also expose iiNet to the risk of wrongful termination, and would go further than simply preventing infringement by also denying iiNet customers the non-infringing uses of the internet connection. Therefore iiNet’s inactivity in the face of infringement notices from copyright holders was not indifference amounting to authorisation. The court was critical of the appellants’ reliance on “countenance” to expand the core notion of “authorise” and highlighted the dangers of relying on synonyms for “authorise” found in the dictionary. The court also noted that the mere conduit exception, s 112E, was enacted from an abundance of caution and has no practical effect.Because iiNet had not authorised its customers acts of infringement, the High Court was not required to examine the operation of the safe harbours. The appeal decision of the Full Federal Court below had held that iiNet was not eligible for the protection of the safe harbours as it had not reasonably implemented an appropriate repeat infringer policy. iiNet had argued that its unwritten policy was to terminate the accounts of subscribers who had admitted to infringement or had been found by a court or other authority to have infringed copyright, or when ordered to do so by a competent court.

The index was populated by links submitted by users, but no infringing material was stored or communicated by Cooper or ComCen. The court found that Cooper had the power to prevent infringement because he could have not provided his website in the first place (Branson J) or could have not accepted or subsequently disabled and removed links to infringing content (Kenny J). Second, the relationship between Cooper and users was commercial, because Cooper benefitted financially from sponsorship and advertisements on the website which directly increased with the volume of infringing content. Finally, the court held that Cooper did not take any reasonable steps to prevent or avoid the infringements. The disclaimer on his website (“When you download a song, you take full responsibility for doing so. None of the files on this site are stored on our servers. We are just providing links to remote files.”) was merely cosmetic and had no real effect. Justice Kenny concluded that the website “was in substance an invitation to use the hyperlinks provided” and that Cooper. The court also held Cooper’s ISP, Comcen, liable for authorisation. The court found that Comcen was aware of the high level of usage of Cooper’s website and its problems with copyright. Comcen also benefited from infringements: Cooper received free web-hosting in exchange for displaying the Comcen logo on his website. Comcen had the power to prevent the infringements because it had the power to withdraw the hosting of Cooper’s website, but that it had not taken the “reasonable steps” of either withdrawing hosting or placing pressure on Cooper to stop his website being used predominantly for copyright infringement.</div>",Australia,,DECISIONS - Lower Courts,2006,Court/Judicial Decision,Lowest Domestic Court,Civil,Copyright,Secondary,Internet Access Provider (Including Mobile)+Host (Including Social Networks),Weakens Immunity,,Framing or Embedding,Block or Remove+Terminate Account,,,Actual Knowledge (General Knowledge That Platform is Being Used for Illegal Activity or to Share Unlawful Content),,,,,,Good/No Action Required,http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2006/187.html,,http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2006/187.html

(ii) The Act also contains exemptions from liability for Internet Services Providers (ISPs) and Internet Protocol Address Providers (IPAPs), provided they comply with specified obligations.

(2) An ISP is defined as any person who does either or both of the following:  (a) offers the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing; or (b) hosts material on websites or other electronic retrieval systems that can be accessed by a user (section 2).   Under Sections 92B to 92E, an ISP will not be liable for storing or caching infringing material unless the ISP:  (a) knows or has reason to believe that the material infringes copyright in the work; and (b) does not, as soon as possible after becoming aware of the infringing material, delete the material or prevent access to it (section 92C).

(3) An IPAP is defined as a person that operates a business that, other than as an incidental feature of its main business activities: (a) offers the transmission, routing, and providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user's choosing; and (b) allocates IP addresses to its account holders; and (c) charges its account holders for its services; and (d) is not primarily operated to cater for transient users.

Wishart sought damages for defamation arising from comments by Murray made on a Facebook page established by Murray called ""Boycott the Macsyna King book""; Murray's Twitter account (linked to Facebook page); and during radio interviews.

(2) An application to strike out was made in part on the basis Murray was not the publisher of third party statements on the Facebook page. Issues included whether HC Judge was correct in finding there was an arguable case that Murray was a publisher of third party statements on the webpage.

(3) Court of Appeal differed from view of HC Judge in central aspect of reasoning based on Emmens v Pottle (1885) 16 QBD 354. Emmens was not authority for the proposition that a person may be found to have published a defamatory statement on the ground that they ought to have known of its existence. Existing case law was of limited assistance: it is important to focus on the particular factual situation before the Court. The host's action, allegedly amounting to infringement by the setting up of the Facebook page, was more closely analogous to the notice on wall situation in Byrne v Dean [1937] 1 KB 818. Byrne v Deane, however, was distinguished in other respects. CA expressed concerns regarding applying the ""ought to know"" test to the host of a Facebook page. The actual knowledge test is consistent with Sadiq v Baycorp (NZ) (see below), A v Google New Zealand Ltd (see below) and Davison v Habeeb [2011] EWHC 3031 (QB), and conformed with the approach in Byrne v Deane and Urbanchich v Drummoyne Municipal Council [1991] Aust Torts Reports 81. The liability risk of a Facebook page host was no greater than that of an organiser of a public meeting.

The news portal enabled users to comment on news articles. Among the comments were 20 comments that according to the claimant, the majority shareholder of the ferry transport company concerned, infringed his personality rights. The claimant argued that the news portal is liable for the damage incurred. Although Delfi implemented pre-examination of comments (if comments included specific vulgar expressions, the comment was not published), this was seen as an ineffective measure.

(2) The Supreme Court upheld previous judgments and reiterated that (i) Delfi is a provider of content services. As such, Delfi governs the content that is stored and should be distinguished from an information service provider, falling under the e-Commerce Directive's Article 14 and its Estonian national implementation (Section 10 of the ISSA), which has neither knowledge of nor control over information which is transmitted or stored. (ii) By integrating the comment environment into its news portal and inviting users to post comments, Delfi could decide which comments to publish or not.  The fact that Delfi did not use this capability did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of comments. In the Supreme Court’s view, because Delfi had a legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other persons, Delfi should have prevented unlawful comments from being published. (iii) Additionally, Delfi acted out of economic considerations and as such, the ISP cannot be seen as acting neutrally. (iv) Finally, the Estonian Supreme Court noted that both Delfi and the authors of the comments could be considered publishers of the comments. Therefore, the defamed party was free to choose against whom to bring the lawsuit.

The Grand Chamber found that the judgement of the Supreme Court of Estonia finding that Delfi is liable for the offensive comments had been a justified and proportionate restriction on the portal’s freedom of expression and the steps taken by Delfi to remove offensive comments without delay after their publication had been insufficient.</div>","<div>(<strong>1</strong>) The case arose when a popular news portal (Delfi) in Estonia published an article about the ferry connection with the islands in Estonia. The news portal enabled users to comment on news articles. Among the comments were 20 comments that according to the claimant, the majority shareholder of the ferry transport company concerned, infringed his personality rights. The claimant argued that the news portal is liable for the damage incurred.&nbsp;Although Delfi implemented pre-examination of comments (if comments included specific vulgar expressions, the comment was not published), this was seen as an ineffective measure.</div>
<div>(<strong>2</strong>) The Supreme Court upheld previous judgments and reiterated that (<strong>i</strong>) Delfi is a provider of content services. As such, Delfi governs the content that is stored and should be distinguished from an information service provider, falling under the e-Commerce Directive's Article 14 and its Estonian national implementation (Section 10 of the ISSA), which has neither knowledge of nor control over information which is transmitted or stored. (<strong>ii</strong>) By integrating the comment environment into its news portal and inviting users to post comments, Delfi could decide which comments to publish or not. &nbsp;The fact that Delfi did not use this capability did not mean that it had no control over the publishing of comments. In the Supreme Court’s view, because Delfi had a legal obligation to avoid causing damage to other persons, Delfi should have prevented unlawful comments from being published. (<strong>iii</strong>) Additionally, Delfi&nbsp;acted out of economic considerations and as such, the ISP cannot be seen as acting neutrally. (<strong>iv</strong>)&nbsp;Finally, the Estonian Supreme Court noted that both Delfi and the authors of the comments could be considered publishers of the comments. Therefore, the defamed party was free to choose against whom to bring the lawsuit.</div>

<div>(<strong>2</strong>) The Constitution contains a special provision (<strong>Article 17</strong>), which provides for the regulation of the limitations of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression.&nbsp;Limitations of Constitutional rights and freedoms may be established only by law in the public interest or for the protection of the rights of others. The restriction must be proportionate to the situation that has dictated it.&nbsp;These limitations may not infringe the essence of freedoms and rights and in no case may exceed the limitations provided for in the European Convention on Human Rights.&nbsp;This article, by defining the cases and conditions as may restrict the rights and fundamental freedoms, in fact reinforces the constitutional guarantee of these rights, while avoiding arbitrary restrictions of their own. Thus Article 17 has determined that the conditions for limiting the rights are:</div>

(2) The Belgian Supreme Court confirmed that the public prosecutor did not violate the law by ordering the ISPs to block all websites redirecting to thepiratebay.org. The Court confirmed that far-reaching blocking orders against all national Internet service providers are lawful. According to the Supreme Court, a magistrate is entitled to order, (i) in a single injunction, (ii) all national Internet service providers to (iii) block access to IP rights-infringing content (iv) which is hosted by a server, linked to a specific main domain name, (v) by employing all possible technical means at their disposal or at least by blocking all domain names that refer to a specified main domain name.

(3) This injunction, the Court noted, did not impose on the ISPs an unlawful obligation to monitor the web, which would be contrary to Art. 15 of the e-commerce Directive. According to the Supreme Court, this order does not trequire the ISPs to (i) monitor the information they transmit or store or (ii) actively seek facts or circumstances evidencing illegal activities.

(4) In dismissing the grivances of the plaintiffs, three ISPs (Telenet, Tecteo and Brutele) in this case, the Supreme court refused to refer a number of questions to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for a preliminary ruling. Specifically, the plaintiffs requested to refer to the ECJ whether the Court of Appeal violated Eu law in failing (i) to specify the particular means they had to employ to comply with the injunction order and (ii) to exhaustively list the domain names to be blocked.

The law is implementing the Directive 2000/31/EC (E-Commerce Directive) on electronic commerce regarding ISP liability.

The plaintiff claimed that Google violated Articles 29 and 36, para.1 of the Law on Protection of Competition. Article 29 states that “Any action or omission when carrying out economic activity, which is contrary to good faith commercial practices and damages or may damage the interests of competitors shall be prohibited.” Article 36 (1) provides that “Carrying out unfair competition, aimed at soliciting clients, as a result of which existing agreements are terminated or breached, or entry into such agreements with competitors is prevented, shall be prohibited.”)

(2) The complaint was prompted by the fact that during the election campaign in Bulgaria in 2014, YouTube was showing ads for various Bulgarian political parties and candidates without complying with the provisions of Art. 138a of the Election Code, which obliges the providers of media services to announce on their web sites information about the contracts concluded with the parties, coalitions and nomination committees that have registered candidates and/or with another contracting authority in connection with the election campaign, if the contract has been concluded with an intermediary. They are also required to present to the Audit Office and the Central Electoral Commission clear advertising tariffs for the political parties during the campaigns. Google did not do so and thus the aims of the Election Code were diluted which led to alleged breach of the Art. 29 and art.36, para.1 of the Law on Protection of Competition.

(3) The plaintiff claims that “although the Election Code does not apply to the social networks, YouTube is not to be considered a social network.” Under § 20 of the Supplementary Provisions of the Election Code “Media service provider” shall be “a sole-trader natural person or a legal person who or which has editorial responsibility for the choice of the content of the media service and determines the manner in which the said service is organized.”

(4) The main argument of the plaintiff is that both the respondent and themselves are to be qualified as Media service providers ergo they should be both subject to the abovementioned obligations.

255,General Introduction - Czech Republic,General Introduction - Czech Republic,"1) Czech law has a only a little experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries. There is no special liability basis for intermediaries. Recently passed new civil law makes no changes in this respect. Safe harbors of e-Commerce directive can especially bar application of the general tort law in cases where wrongful omission could have been established.


(2) General tort law establishes direct liability of an intermediary when he himself or with his co-tortfeasors full-fills all the elements of a tort by infringing the right of others. This qualification depends on the right that is being infringed, and can be different for different fields of law, e.g. personality rights infringement and copyright infringement can treat an intermediary differently. Own content of an intermediary would usually lead to a direct liability.

(3) If the intermediary did not act as a direct infringer, he can be liable under one of the following legal institutions: (i) accessory liability (liability as a participant), (ii) vicarious liability (§ 2914 Civil Code), (iii) wrongful omission (§§ 2900, 2901, 2910 Civil Code + absolute right at stake).

(4) Unlike in the criminal law, accessory liability is not well-developed in the Czech civil law. Even though new Czech Civil Code mentions this type of liability in § 2915, it does not define its preconditions. The Czech courts also seldom distinguish it from other basis of liability. The inspiration of the principles upon which it is based hence comes mainly from the criminal law (similarly as in Slovakia). This requires intentional assistance of third parties in wrongful acts of others. Nevertheless, it is possible that accessory liability under civil law could develop into a more broad concept, where also negligence would suffice. At this point, however, there are no signs of such a move in the case-law.

(5) Vicarious liability under § 2914 of the Civil Code can apply only to small number of cases. Under this provision the damage shall be considered caused by a legal entity or by an individual also if they were caused by auxiliaries in the course of their activity for the principal. Czech courts so far did not apply the provision to any intermediary scenario.

(6) Wrongful omission is probably the most important basis of civil liability in the context of intermediaries. As the Civil Code is very new, there is no case-law on this issue in the context of intermediaries, yet. The law, however, enables to hold negligent omission of intermediaries wrongful and attach a liability to such inactivity provided that certain standard of duty of care is breached. Czech law distinguishes cases of negligent wrongful omissions from negligent actions. The former is triggered only in exceptional situations outlined by the law (dangerous activity, close relationship, etc.).

(7) It is worth mentioning that Czech safe harboring system unfortunately instead of the negative language of the Directive (“is not liable if ..”), uses a positive one (“is liable if ..”), which gives an impression that losing of safe harbors leads to establishment of the liability. First Czech decisions interpreting this provision (Prolux and share-rapid.cz) seems to be embracing this reading. Contrary to what was reported in the EU study, Czech law has no special rules on notice and take down procedure. Injunctions can be issued against intermediaries even if they are not infringing rights of others. In the field of intellectual property law, the implementation of Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive and Art. 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive enables this. The relevant provisions are incorporated in Act on Enforcement of Industrial Property Rights and the Copyright Act. It is not yet clarified if the same is possible in the field of personality rights and unfair competition law.","<span>) Czech law has a only a little experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries.

Mc Fadden operated his wireless LAN with anonymous access and free of charge in the vicinity of his business. Access was intentionally not protected in order to draw the attention of customers of near-by shops, of passers-by and of neighbours to his company. The referring court wanted to know whether the access provider exemption from liability might preclude from finding Mc Fadden liable, either directly or secondary.

(2) Against this factual background, the ECJ concluded that
(a) making a network available to the general public free of charge constitutes an ‘information society service’ within the meaning of Article 12(1) of Directive 2000/31 where the activity is performed by the wiress LAN operator for the purposes of advertising the goods sold or services supplied by that service provider;

(d) the scope the access provider exemption in 12(1)--as limited by the carve-outs for injunctions permitted by Art 12(3)--does not preclude injunctions requiring a free-access wireless LAN operator to prevent third parties from making a copyright-protected work available from an online (peer-to-peer) exchange platform via an internet connection;

(e) the wireless LAN operator may choose which technical measures to take in order to comply with the injunction, however the injuntion will not be precluded even if such a choice is limited to a single measure consisting in password-protecting the internet connection, provided that those users are required to reveal their identity in order to obtain the required password and may not therefore act anonymously.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) The ECJ had to consider&nbsp;the potential liability of Mr. Mc Fadden--running a business selling lighting and sound systems--for the use by a third party of the wireless local area network (WLAN) operated by Mc Fadden in order to make a phonogram produced by Sony Music available to the general public without authorisation.

Mc Fadden operated his wireless LAN&nbsp;with anonymous access&nbsp;and&nbsp;free of charge in the vicinity of his business.&nbsp;Access was intentionally not protected in order to draw the attention of customers of near-by shops, of passers-by and of neighbours to his company.&nbsp;The referring court wanted to know whether the access provider exemption from liability might preclude from finding Mc Fadden liable, either directly or secondary.</div>

Prior to this case, the Court decided linking related issues in Svensson and Bestwater (see below). The request for a preliminary ruling came from the Supreme Court of Sweden. The online broadcaster C More Entertainment challenged the legality of Mr. Sandberg’s website hosting links enabling users to circumvent a paywall to watch its live streams of hockey matches. The ECJ concluded that national legislation may extend the exclusive right of the broadcasting organisations to acts of communication to the public encompassing broadcasts of sporting fixtures made live on internet.

(2) The referring court decided to drop a number of questions concerning whether placing clickable links on a website may be classified as an act of communication to the public. The ECJ already answered those questions in Svensson, noting that links communicate works to the public, but they are not infringing unless they make the work available to a new public. Therefore, links to authorized works freely available online do not infringe the right of communication to the public. In contrast, a link enabling users to circumvent a paywall would communicate the work to a new public and would be infringing.

(3) In this case, however, C More Entertainment does not own a copyright in the underlying sport event, which, as discussed here, does not reach the level of originality required for copyright protection. Instead, C More Entertainment enjoys a related right in the broadcasting of the sport event. According to Article 3(2)(d) of Directive 2001/29, Member States must provide broadcasting organisations with  “the exclusive right to authorise or prohibit the making available” of fixations of their broadcasts to the public, “in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.” According to the ECJ, this ""right of making available to the public"" forms part of the wider ""right of communication to the public,"" which Article 3(1) grants to authors. The ECJ confirmed that “making available to the public” is intended to refer to ‘interactive on-demand transmissions’ characterized by the fact that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. As the ECJ noted, “that is not the case of transmissions broadcast live on internet.” C More Entertainment’s live streams of hockey matches would fall out of the scope of the rights granted by EU law to broadcasting organizations.

(4) Against this factual and legal background, the Swedish Supreme Court maintained only one question for the ECJ: May the Member States give wider protection to the exclusive right of authors by enabling “communication to the public” to cover a greater range of acts than provided for in Article 3(2) of [Directive 2001/29]? In practice, should Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29 be interpreted as precluding national legislation from extending the exclusive right of the broadcasting organisations to acts of communication to the public encompassing broadcasts of sporting fixtures made live on internet? Does EU law preclude Member States to extend the exclusive rights of the broadcasters to those acts which could be classified as ""acts of communication to the public"" but which do not constitute ""acts of making available to the public the fixations of their broadcasts in such a way that members of the public may access them from a place and at a time individually chosen by them""?

(5) The ECJ answered to this question in the negative and held that “Directive 2006/115 [on Rental Right and Lending Right and on Certain Rights related to Copyright in the Field of Intellectual Property] gives the Member States the option of providing for more protective provisions with regard to the broadcasting and communication to the public of transmissions made by broadcasting organisations than those which must be instituted in accordance with Article 8(3) of that directive.” Therefore, the ECJ concluded, Article 3(2) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation from extending the exclusive broadcasting organisations' right of making available to the public referred to in Article 3(2)(d) to acts of communication to the public including live internet streams of sport events.] [See also CIS blog]","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) The ECJ had to decide whether linking to live internet streams of sport events infringed on the exclusive related rights of broadcasting organizations.&nbsp;Prior to this case,&nbsp;the Court decided linking related issues in&nbsp;<a href=""https://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2014/03/freedom-linking-europe"">Svensson&nbsp;</a>and Bestwater (see below).&nbsp;The request for a preliminary ruling came from the Supreme Court of Sweden.

The case involved journalists claiming that the website Retriever Sverige had improperly linked to news articles they had authored, thereby making those articles available to the public without permission, in violation of copyright law.

(1) For the first time, the ECJ announced a rule that links communicate works to the public, which is a copyright owner’s sole prerogative under EU law. However, the court said that those links are not infringing and do not need additional authorization from the copyright owner unless they make the work available to a new public (par. 25-28). A new public must include people other than those who can access the work thanks to the rightsholders’ conduct. In other words, if the rightsholder publishes the work online, anyone can link to it without further permission.

(2) Next, the ECJ decided that for copyright purposes, there is no difference between a link which takes the user to another website where the work (presumably) is lawfully displayed and one which embeds the work, giving the impression that it is appearing on the linking website. Because only a link that communicates the work to a “new public” infringes the copyright holders’ exclusive right (par. 30), copyright law does not offer any redress for this practice. However, the ECJ does not exclude the possibility that courts may still sanction this practice under some circumstances as a form of unfair competition.

(3) Finally, the ECJ decided that Member States are not entitled to give wider protection to authors by defining “communication to the public” more broadly than is done in the InfoSoc Directive (par. 33-41).] [See also CIS blog.]","<div>[The ECJ decided that links to authorized works freely available online do not infringe the E.U.-recognized exclusive right of communication to the public.&nbsp;The case involved journalists claiming that the website Retriever Sverige had improperly linked to news articles they had authored, thereby making those articles available to the public without permission, in violation of copyright law.</div>

Balancing ISP customers’ privacy with content industry’s ability to protect its intellectual property, theECJ held that European law alone does not require ISPs to disclose their subscribers’ identities to trade organizations for the purpose of civil litigation against the subscribers in order to ensure effective protection of copyright.

The collecting rights society GEMA sought to enjoin Deutsche Telekom from providing access to the website ""3dl.am,"" hosting links to files in file repositories such as Netload, Uploaded or Rapidshare, which contain material for which GEMA members own the copyright.

(2) According to Article 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive, the Court noted that access providers could be enjoined from providing access to sites hosting or linking to copyright infringing material if they knowingly provided the means to allow the infringement, provided they failed to take reasonable care. Additionally, blocking injunctions were not only permissible when the blocked domain contained exclusively infringing material, but also when the legal material was insubstantial compared to the illegal material.

(3) The Court also noted that the fact that it was always technically possible to circumvent blocks did not mean that they were ineffective as such.

(4) However, a blocking injunction against an ISP required that the rightholders had first taken steps against the primary infringer, such as the website operator or host provider, and failed to stop the infringement, or it was clear from the outset that there was no likelihood of success at all to prevent the primary infringement.  The rightholders had to take reasonable steps, for example by hiring a private investigator or involving criminal prosecution authorities, to determine the identity and location of the primary infringer.

GEMA then sued the host provider, but withdrew the complaint after it became clear that the host provider's address was false, too.

Rapidshare</a>, I ZR 80/12, August 15, 2013</strong></div>","(1) This case concerns a dispute between the German copyright collecting society, GEMA, and the Swiss-based file-hosting service, RapidShare. GEMA sued RapidShare in Germany, alleging that over 4,800 copyrighted music files were shared via RapidShare without consent from GEMA or the right holders.

(2) According to the Court, although RapidShare’s business model is not primarily designed for violating rights, it nevertheless provides incentives to third parties to illegally share copyrighted content. It does so by (i) generating revenues through premium accounts which enhance massive data downloads, rather than on fees for storage space, as it is common for cloud computing; (ii) providing anonymous accounts to its user.; (iii) having an abuse rate of 5 to 6 percent - as acknowledged by Rapidshare - that corresponds to approximately 30,000 infringing acts daily.

(3) Therefore, the Court saw fit to impose some additional duties on RapidShare to mitigate infringements.  As the court announced earlier in  ATARI v. RapidShare (see below), RapidShare (and similar file-hosting services) should abide to more stringent monitoring duties.  File-hosting services are now required to actively monitor incoming links to discover copyrighted files as soon as there is a specific reason to do so and to then ensure that these files become inaccessible to the public.  As indicated by the Court, the service provider should use all possible resources - including search engines, Facebook, Twitter or web crawlers - to identify links made accessible to the public by user generated repositories of links.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) This case concerns a dispute between the German copyright collecting society, GEMA, and the Swiss-based file-hosting service, RapidShare.

The injunction sought was pursuant to s.40 (5A) of the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000 (as amended) (see above) requiring that the defendant take reasonable steps to prevent its subscribers from using the defendant’s internet service for the purpose of breaching the plaintiffs’ copyright in the plaintiffs’ sound recordings

(2) According to the court, the essential elements of a GRS are that ""(i) the owners of the copyright send to the ISP a list of infringements with reference to specific internet protocol addresses; (The copyright owners can only identify the specific IP address. They cannot identify the name and address of the subscriber). However when this information is sent to the defendant, the defendant as the ISP can, using the IP addresses, identify the name and address of its subscribers. (ii) It then writes to its subscribers informing them that these matters have come to its attention. (iii) The second letter is a second reminder or threat of further action. (iv) The third step would be the suspension of the account for a week. (v) The fourth step would be the termination of the account.""

(3) The Court granted an injunction as sought by the plaintiff imposing upon UPC an obligation to implement a GRS as the European ""directives permit the courts of Member States to impose injunctions on internet service providers [, . . . ] even though ISPs are not regarded as liable in law for the actions of their subscribers,"" due the availability of a ""mere conduit"" defense. According to the injuction, the GRS cannot encompass any suspension or termination of users' accounts but only the disclosure of information to make a Norwich Pharmacal order to finally seek an accounts' suspension or termination. The GRS should encompass the following steps:
Step 1 - That the plaintiffs would furnish all relevant infringement information to the defendant and that the plaintiffs would bear the cost of this process.
Step 2 - That the defendant, when it receives a first copyright infringement notification from the plaintiffs, would send its subscribers a letter setting out the infringement and requesting him/her to cease and desist.
Step 3 - That the defendant where it receives a second copyright infringement notification would send a second letter to its subscriber requesting him/her to cease and desist.
Step 4 - That the defendant, where it receives a third copyright infringement in respect of a subscriber from the plaintiffs, would send to the plaintiffs a notification that a subscriber account has been the subject matter of three such notifications.
Step 5 - The plaintiffs, having been informed of a third copyright infringement notification and having been informed of the relevant IP addresses etc, could make a Norwich Pharmacal type application to ascertain the subscriber’s identity and address and the plaintiffs could then seek an order under s.40 (5A) for the suspension and/or termination of the subscriber’s service. Such applications would not be opposed or consented to by the defendant and the defendant would not seek its costs.
(4) Finally, the Court noted, on the issue of allocation of costs, that ""because the defendant is the company which profits - albeit indirectly - because it derives revenue from its subscribers who are engaged in this practice, it is the defendant who should, in my view, be primarily liable for the costs."" Therefore, according to the Court, UPC will be required to bear 80% of the costs estimated between €800,000 and €940,000. However, the plaintiffs may only send to UPC up to 2,500 infringment notifications per month.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) The plaintiffs, Sony, Universal and Warner Music, sought an injunction to impose upon UPC Communications, the second largest Irish Internet access provider, an obligation to implement a ""Graduated Response Strategy"" (GRS) against UPC's subscribers allegedly infringing plaintiffs' copyrights online.

(""RTI"") owned the copyright.

(2) The Court supported its decision basically on two arguments:
Identification of the activity of Break Media as ""active hosting"" and not just ""passive hosting"". According to the Court, Break Media is not a simple host of media content but a sophisticated content-provider. Indeed, the activity of Break Media is not limited to the activation of technical procedures for enabling the content to be loaded to the platform (""passive hosting""), but requires of a complex and sophisticated organization of advertising exploitation of the content loaded to the platform which is selected, addressed, related and associated to other contents in order to deliver to the user an audiovisual product, which has a better quality, complexity and a precise and specific autonomy (""active hosting""). As a result, the defenses of the E-Commerce Directive are not applicable, and general rules on liability apply.
Effective knowledge of Break Media of transmission of illegal files. Although the communication sent by RTI demanding Break Media the removal of the infringing content from the platform did not identify the specific URL (precise and specific location of the content to be removed), the effective knowledge of the defendant of the infringing nature of the content was enough (which in this case was evident, also by the fact that the content clearly showed the broadcaster’s trademark).

(3) The Court of Rome prohibited Break Media from further violating the rights of RTI by imposing a penalty of EUR 1,000 per each day of violation of such prohibition, and condemned Break Media to the payment of damages caused to RTI which were estimated in EUR 115,000 basing on an estimation of the royalties that Break Media would have had to pay for a license to stream the content. Finally, it ordered Break Media to pay expenses of the trial, and to publish the decision for two consecutive times in nation-wide printed and online magazines and in the homepage of Break Media.

(2) The AGCOM Regulation does not primarily enforce copyright but any failure to comply with an order of the Authority. Therefore, this order cannot be considered illegitimate for (a) AGCOM's incompetence to introduce a para-judicial procedure to enforce copyright or (b) inconsistency between this procedure and the rules of law which entrust to the ordinary courts the enforcement of copyright, or even, for (c) breach of the principle of the judge previously ascertained by law in so far as judicial review of AGCOM measures is done by the administrative judge, rather than civil or criminal.

(3) The AGCOM Regulation does not violate EU or national law in so far as it provides that the order is addressed only to hosting and access service providers and not to uploader, manager of the page and the website operator. This is because EU and national law provide that ISPs may be subject to supervisory authorities' measures aimed at limiting the negative externalities of their activities (see Art. 8(3), Dir. 2001/29/EC and Art. 11, Dir. 2004/48/EC).

(4) The AGCOM Regulation does not violate the adversarial principle in so far as it provides a very short deadline for the submission of counter-arguments. Actually, this principle governs criminal and civil proceedings, and possibly administrative proceedings of contentious nature. It does not apply to purely administrative proceedings, which are governed by the principle of ""participation in the proceedings"", which can be balanced for reasons of urgency that the authority may identify.

Wikimedia Foundation Inc. Italia</a>, 70572/09, July 9, 2014</strong></div>","[(1) Italian politicians Antonio Angelucci and his son claimed that Wikipedia pages related to the Angeluccis contained false statements supposedly harming the family’s reputation. The allegedly defamatory statements referred to bribery scandals involving the Angeluccis. Although, upon notice of Angelucci’s claim, Wikimedia removed the allegedly defamatory information, the Angeluccis sought €20,000,000 in damages from the Wikimedia Foundation. The plaintiffs argued that Wikimedia should be treated like a content provider, rather than hosting, and should be liable under the stricter standard that apply to the Italian press as an online journal.

(2) The Court of Rome rejected plaintiffs' argument and stated that Wikimedia Foundation serves as a hosting provider in managing the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Therefore, the liability standards applying to the Italian press cannot be extended to Wikimedia, as “unlike the case of press publication, there is no contractual relationship between the author of the [allegedly infringing] content and the hosting provider; and [casting liability upon] this [conduct], coupled with the enormous amount of data uploaded by users, would imply a form of objective liability that cannot find justification in the present [Italian] legal framework.”

(3) In coming down to this conclusion, the Roman Court noted that, while the Directive does not directly apply to the Wikimedia Foundation as a non-EU-based organization, the basic principles of the Directive apply. According to those principles, Wikipedia enjoys an exemption from liability, as a hosting provider, unless “it does not act to remove, or block access to, the infringing information, if it gets explicit notice of this information by the competent authorities.”

(4) Unlike a content provider, a hosting provider does not have any obligation to monitor the content published by its users to prevent defamation of a third party. The court stated that Wikipedia “offers a service which is based on the freedom of the users to draft the various pages of the encyclopedia; it is such freedom that excludes any [obligation to guarantee the absence of offensive content on its sites] and which finds its balance in the possibility for anybody to modify contents and ask for their removal.”

(5) The court also excluded any form of liability of Wikipedia for carrying out a “dangerous activity.” Theoretically, Article 2050 of the Italian Civil Code would provide a legal basis for this type of liability. As the Court noted, this liability may follow from the “danger of uncontrolled, immediate and pervasive circulation of news that the online platform [managed by Wikimedia] may allow to an indiscriminate number of people.” However, the Court went on to state that Wikimedia was very clear in its disclaimers about its neutral role in the creation and maintenance of content. This disclaimer about the truthfulness of any statements included in Wikipedia would “exclude any involvement of the hosting provider in the defamation.”] [see also CIS Blog post.]","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>)&nbsp;Italian politicians Antonio Angelucci and his son claimed that Wikipedia pages related to the Angeluccis contained false statements supposedly harming the family’s reputation.

The Court therefore ordered Facebook to release any information relating to the owner of the fake account. In case Facebook is unable to release such information, the company should allow an independent third-party to investigate whether Facebook had or still has the information, and what that information entailed or entails.

Following the Directive it differentiates between mere conduit, catching and hosting, introducing no obligation to monitor or filter hosted or cached content as well as a basic notice-and-takedown procedure. The Act determines obligations of information service providers (ISPs), rules for insulating them from legal liability as well as rules for the protection of personal data treated by the intermediaries.

(1) Definitions. According to the Act, “providing services by electronic” means to render a service by transmitting and collecting data by means of teleinformation systems, at the individual request of a service recipient, without the parties being simultaneously present, while the data are transmitted through public networks. It distinguishes between a “service provider” and a “service recipient” whereby the former is understood as “any natural person, legal person or organizational unit without legal entity, who, while performing, even as side activities, commercial or professional activities provides services by electronic means”. The Act does not differentiate between access, service or content providers.

(2) Media and Publishers Liability. Although the Act on rendering electronic services explicitly does not cover media (Article 3), Poland has been one of the first European states to recognize the editorial liability of information service providers (see case State Prosecutor v. Norbert Z. & Tomasz K below).

(3) Spam. The Act covers also intermediary liability for spam introducing an opt-in model of spam protection. Article 9 requires commercial information to be clearly separated and marked in a manner that no doubt may arise that it is information of a commercial character. Article 10 prohibits sending unsolicited commercial information to a specified recipient - who never expressed any specific consent to receive it -  by electronic communication means.

(4) Liability Exemptions. Chapter 3 of the Act is devoted to liability exemptions for ISPs. Article 12 introduces the mere conduit exemption stating that no responsibility for conveyed data shall be borne by the one who, while transmitting data, is not an initiator of the transmission, does not select the recipient of data, nor deletes or modifies the data subject to transmission. The exemption covers also automated and short-term indirect storing of such data, if this activity aims exclusively at proceeding with the transmission, and the data are not stored longer than it is ordinarily necessary for accomplishing the transmission. Similarly an exemption for caching services providers is provided in Article 13, which excludes any responsibility for stored data of entities transmitting data and providing for automated and short-term indirect storing of the data in order to make them quickly accessible on the request of another entity if they do not delete or modify the data, use information techniques recognized and usually applied for such activities and do not interfere with such techniques.

(5) Notice and Take Down. The notice and takedown procedure for cached illegal content is provided for in Article 13 par. 2 which exempts from liability for stored data the person, who, “immediately erases the data or makes the access to the stored data impossible as soon as he/she receives the message that the data have been erased from the initial source of transmission or the access to them has been made impossible, or a court or any other competent authority has ordered to erase the data or to make the access to them impossible.” Similar regulations relating to hosting providers can be found in Article 14 which exempts from liability for stored data a person, who, while making the resources of a teleinformation system available for the purpose of the data storage by a service recipient, is not aware of unlawful nature of the data or the activity related to them, and in case of “having been officially informed or having received a credible notice on the unlawful nature of the data or the activity related to them, makes the access to the data immediately impossible”. The terms “official information”, “credible notice” and “immediately” have not been defined in the Act nor in accompanying jurisprudence, resulting in much autonomy for service providers in making their decisions. This autonomy requires ISPs to make autonomous decisions on the credibility of the information received, legality of content and due time for such content to be disabled. There is no detailed notice-and-takedown procedure on formal and procedural conditions of filing a notice and its consequences in place, nor is there coherent self regulation in this area, with individual service providers making their decision individually. This situation causes an undesired chilling effect resulting in intermediary service providers disabling most content reported as potentially illegal in order to avoid any liability.

(6) Personal Data Protection. The Act introduces also detailed obligations of intermediary service providers regarding the rules of the Personal Data Protection Related to Providing Services by Electronic Means in Articles 16–24","<div>[This Act implemented the EU Electronic Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, introducing intermediary liability for unlawful content.

The terms “publications” and “periodical” have no legal definitions therefore their  dictionary definitions apply, with “publications” referring to all content enabled publicly and “periodically” designating content updated within certain amounts of time. In the context of Article 7 para 2 pt 1, which explicitly qualifies press as printed publications published within less than one year, it may be argued that online publications updated at least once a year fall within that category. A “press release” is defined in Article 7 as any information, data or image that appears or is designated to appear in the press.

(2) Media and Publishers Liability. Editorial liability is defined in Article 37 of the Press Law Act, which states that the “responsibility for harm caused by rights injured due to the publishing of a press release shall be set according to general rules, unless the Act states differently."" Individual standards for editorial liability are defined in Article 38 of the Press Law Act, which provides for joint and several civil liability for damage caused by publishing a press release of “the author, editor or any other person, who had caused for that press material to be published”, including the publisher. The Press Law Act defines an editor as a journalist who decides or co-decides on the publication of a press release, enabling  for the qualification of content providers but also hosting providers as publishers.

(3) Registration. The Press Law Act creates two categories of press: daily newspapers and periodicals, where the former is defined as a general-information periodical in print or sound or sound and vision message published more frequently than once a week, and the latter as a periodical print published at least once a year but not more frequently than once a week, as well as messages broadcast by means of sound or sound and vision and any other means.

In general, the decree presents a scope similar to the Directive. When examined in more detail though, one can observe that the decree, in certain aspects, went beyond the Directive, regulating a number of legal issues that were not explicitly covered by the Portuguese legal system and neither by the Directive.

(2) The provisions of the Decree-Law that address the liability of service providers can be found in Chapter III (Articles 11 – 19), entitled ""Liability of networking service providers.""

(i) The statute implements the liability regime estiblesed by the eCommerce directive for the activities of “mere conduit” (Article 14), “caching” or intermediary storage (Article 15) and “hosting” or main storage (Article 16).

(ii) Article 17 regulates the intermediary liability of service providers for content aggregation. This notion refers to hyperlinking and search engines as these are deemed to aggregate “content” by referencing third-party content. Portugal is thus one of the few Member States which introduced specific norms dealing with liability for hyperlinking and liability of search engines. Content aggregator service providers, which allow access to illegal contents by hyperlinking or search engines, are subject to the same liability regime of hosting service providers.

(iii) Article 18, No.1, establishes that in cases of linking and hosting (Articles 16 and 17), the service provider is not bound to remove the disputed contents or to disable access to the information on the grounds of a claim made by an interested party, where the illegality is not obvious (i.e., in cases in which the information or activity is not manifestly illegal). Additionally, Article18 regulate the procedure of out-of-court preliminary dispute settlement regarding cases, whose illegality is not obvious. According to such procedure, any interested party may appeal to the relevant supervisory entity (the authority is designed according to its competences; ANACOM – Communications National Authority – is the competent authority by default). Moreover, whoever has a legal interest in maintaining that content online is likewise entitled to appeal to the supervisory entity against a decision of the provider to remove or disable access to that content. The recourse to these procedures does not prejudice the capacity of any interested parties to obtain judicial redress through an action brought before a civil or criminal court.

(iv) Article 19 – entitled “Relationship with the right to information” – establishes that content aggregation shall not trigger liability on the sole ground that there are illegal contents in the linked website, despite the awareness of this fact by the provider. The provision further elaborates on this point by stating that the link is legal if performed with objectivity, and represents a way of exercising the right to information. On the contrary, the link shall be deemed illegal if it is a way of adopting the illegal content being linked to as one’s own. The assessment of the legality of linking is made by considering the circumstances of the case, namely:
the possible confusion of contents of the linking and linked websites;
the automatic or intentional character of the link;
the area of linked website to which the link is made.","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) Transposes into national law Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market (Directive on electronic commerce).&nbsp;In general, the decree presents a scope similar to the Directive.

<div>(<strong>3</strong>) According to <strong>Article 30, par. 2</strong>, miscellaneous <strong>online platforms</strong> - such as internet forums, social networks, and other platforms which enable free exchange of information, ideas and opinions - or any other individual electronic publication - such as blogs, web presentations, and similar electronic presentation - <strong>do not qualify as media</strong> under this law, <u>unless they are registered with the Media Register</u>. Therefore, apparently, this law would apply to online intermediaries only under these narrow circumstances.</div>
<div>(<strong>4</strong>) According to <strong>Article 59</strong>, upon the request of a Public Prosecutor, the Court can <strong>block</strong> the distribution of information or other media content if this is necessary in democratic society and if information refers to:</div>
<ul><li>an act of direct violent overthrow of the constitutional order;</li>
<li>an act of direct violence towards a person or a group of persons due to their race, nationality, political views, religion, sexual preferences, invalidity, or any other personal characteristics, if by publishing such information there is a direct, imminent, serious and irreparable harm, whose occurrence cannot be prevented in any other way.</li></ul>
<div>(<strong>5</strong>) <strong>Article 75</strong> specifically provides for the prevention of <strong>hate speech</strong> by stating that ideas, opinions, or information published in media, must not encourage discrimination, hate or violence against any person or group of persons due to their race or not belonging to certain race, religion, nation, gender, sexual preferences, or any other personal characteristic, irrespective of whether by publishing such information a criminal offence has been committed or not</div>
<div>(<strong>6</strong>) However, <strong>Article 76</strong> provides that there is no breach of Article 75, if the information allegedly violating Article 75 is a part of a journalistic article and has been published:</div>
<ul><li>without an intention to encourage discrimination, hate or violence against person or a group of persons, especially if such information is a part of an objective journalistic report;</li>

539,General Introduction - Slovakia,General Introduction - Slovakia,"(1) Slovak law has a very small experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries. Most of the decided or pending cases concern instances of online defamation. There is no special liability basis for intermediaries. Safe harbors of e-Commerce directive can especially bar application of the general tort law in cases where wrongful omission could have been established.


(2) General tort law establishes direct liability of an intermediary when he himself or with his co-tortfeasors fulfills all the elements of a tort by infringing the right of others. This qualification depends on the right that is being infringed, and can be different for different fields of law, e.g. personality rights infringement and copyright infringement can treat an intermediary differently. Own content of an intermediary would usually lead to a direct liability.

(3) If the intermediary did not act as a direct infringer, he can be liable under one of the following legal institutions: (i) accessory liability (liability as a participant), (ii) vicarious liability (§ 420(2) Civil Code), (iii) wrongful omission (§§ 415, 420 Civil Code + absolute right at stake).

(4) Unlike in criminal law, accessory liability is not well-developed in Slovak civil law. The courts seldom distinguish it from other basis of liability. The inspiration of the principles upon which it is based hence comes mainly from criminal law. This requires intentional assistance of third parties in wrongful acts of others. Nevertheless, it is possible that accessory liability under civil law could develop into a more broad concept, where also negligence would suffice. At this point, however, there are no signs of such a move in case law.

(5) Vicarious liability under § 420(2) of the Civil Code can apply only to a small number of cases. Under this provision the damage shall be considered caused by a legal entity or also by an individual if they were caused in the course of their activity by those who were used in such activity. These persons themselves shall not be liable for the damage caused in this way. Slovak courts so far did not apply the provision to any intermediary scenario.

(6) Wrongful omission is probably the most important basis of civil liability in the context of intermediaries. Despite virtually no case law, the law enables to hold negligent omission of intermediaries wrongful and attach a liability to such inactivity provided that certain standard of duty of care is breached.

(7) It is worth mentioning that the Slovak safe harboring system is of very inferior quality. The law implementing the e-Commerce directive was adopted in the period of entry of Slovak to European Union, when thousands of acts were very quickly passed to satisfy the Union law. The main problems are extension of actual knowledge requirement also to mere conduits and caching providers, wording of prohibition of the general monitoring obligation that borders with nonsense and narrow definition of the hosting activities. Slovak implementation also drops constructive knowledge standards. Most of the issues are possible to overcome with interpretation in accordance with the Union law. Contrary to what was reported in the EU study, Slovak law has no special rules on notice and takedown procedures.

(8) Injunctions can be issued against intermediaries even if they are not infringing on the rights of others. In the field of intellectual property law, the implementation of Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive and Art. 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive enables this. The relevant provisions are incorporated in the individual intellectual property rights laws (e.g. Copyright Act, Design Law Act, etc.). It is not yet clarified if the same is possible in the field of personality rights and unfair competition law.","<p><strong>SUMMARY&nbsp;</strong><span>(provided by Martin Husovec): (1) Slovak law has a very small experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries.

It is not yet clarified if the same is possible in the field of personality rights and unfair competition law.</div>","<p><strong>SUMMARY&nbsp;</strong><span>(provided by Martin Husovec): (1) Slovak law has a very small experience with application of the general tort law principles to on-line intermediaries. Most of the decided or pending cases concern instances of online defamation. There is no special liability basis for intermediaries. Safe harbors of e-Commerce directive can especially bar application of the general tort law in cases where wrongful omission could have been established.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>(<strong>2</strong>) General tort law establishes direct liability of an intermediary when he himself or with his co-tortfeasors fulfills all the elements of a tort by infringing the right of others.&nbsp;This qualification depends on the right that is being infringed, and can be different for different fields of law, e.g. personality rights infringement and copyright infringement can treat an intermediary differently. Own content of an intermediary would usually lead to a direct liability.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>3</strong>) If the intermediary did not act as a direct infringer, he can be liable under one of the following legal institutions:&nbsp;(i) accessory liability (liability as a participant),&nbsp;(ii) vicarious liability (§ 420(2) Civil Code),&nbsp;(iii) wrongful omission (§§ 415, 420 Civil Code + absolute right at stake).&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>4</strong>) Unlike in criminal law, accessory liability is not well-developed in Slovak civil law. The courts seldom distinguish it from other basis of liability. The inspiration of the principles upon which it is based hence comes mainly from criminal law.&nbsp;This requires intentional assistance of third parties in wrongful acts of others. Nevertheless, it is possible that accessory liability under civil law could develop into a more broad concept, where also negligence would suffice. At this point, however, there are no signs of such a move in case law.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>5</strong>) Vicarious liability under § 420(2) of the Civil Code can apply only to a small number of cases. Under this provision the damage shall be considered caused by a legal entity or also by an individual if they were caused in the course of their activity by those who were used in such activity. These persons themselves shall not be liable for the damage caused in this way. Slovak courts so far did not apply the provision to any intermediary scenario.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>6</strong>) Wrongful omission is probably the most important basis of civil liability in the context of intermediaries. Despite virtually no case law, the law enables to hold negligent omission of intermediaries wrongful and attach a liability to such inactivity provided that certain standard of duty of care is breached.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>7</strong>) It is worth mentioning that the Slovak safe harboring system is of very inferior quality. The law implementing the e-Commerce directive was adopted in the period of entry of Slovak to European Union, when thousands of acts were very quickly passed to satisfy the Union law.&nbsp;The main problems are extension of actual knowledge requirement also to mere conduits and caching providers, wording of prohibition of the general monitoring obligation that borders with nonsense and narrow definition of the hosting activities. Slovak implementation also drops constructive knowledge standards. Most of the issues are possible to overcome with interpretation in accordance with the Union law. Contrary to what was reported in the EU study, Slovak law has no special rules on notice and takedown procedures.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>8</strong>) Injunctions can be issued against intermediaries even if they are not infringing on the rights of others. In the field of intellectual property law, the implementation of Art. 11 of the Enforcement Directive and Art. 8(3) of the InfoSoc Directive enables this. The relevant provisions are incorporated in the individual intellectual property rights laws (e.g. Copyright Act, Design Law Act, etc.).

544,General Introduction - Slovenia,General Introduction - Slovenia,"(1) Intermediary liability of internet service providers is a relatively new issue in Slovenian case law and legal doctrine. Most cases refer to the infringements of personal rights through defamatory statements.

(2) In Slovenian law, the Electronic Commerce Market Act implements the safe harbor regime which was introduced by the eCommerce directive. However, there are no specific statutory provisions that are able to provide a special liability basis for intermediaries. Therefore, their liability must be determined according to general rules of tortious liability. Due to the fact that Slovenian law limits the establishment of liability for third parties to the existence of a specific relationship between that party and the primary infringer (e.g. parental liability or liability for employees) and that the establishment of strict liability must be explicitly provided by law, internet intermediaries will only be liable for their own conduct – action or omission (e.g. if they support or induce the infringement). Therefore culpability is a necessary prerequisite for the establishment of extra-contractual liability for online intermediaries.

(3) However, according to case law (see cases VSM I Cp 11/2015,  VSL I Cp 252/2014 and VSL I Cp 3037/2011 below), it is likely that internet intermediaries will be liable if they cannot establish a valid safe harbor defense. In other words, if an online intermediary acquires knowledge of an illegal activity and does nothing to prevent it, it will automatically become liable as its inaction will be interpreted as a dereliction of a duty of care (either intentionally or negligently). In this respect, the safe harbor provisions, which were intended to protect against liability, may be interpreted by Slovenian courts to add grounds for its establishment.

(4) Injunctions can be based on the Electronic Commerce Market Act as well as on some other statutes (e.g. article 134 of Code of Obligations for infringements of personal rights). In addition, according to case law, injunctions can also be based on a legal doctrine similar to the German principle of disturbance liability (Störerhaftung) (see case VSL I Cpg 862/2013 below).","<p><u><strong>SUMMARY</strong></u> (provided by&nbsp;Damjan Bonač): (<strong>1</strong>) Intermediary liability of internet service providers is a relatively new issue in Slovenian case law and legal doctrine.

(2) The Court of Appeal applied the language of the new copyright reform (see above) by stressing that the webmaster went well beyond a mere passive neutral intermediary role by selecting, ordering and indexing the online resources to access the infringing materials. For this reason, the webmaster could not benefit of the linking safe harbour, specifically provided by the Spanish implementation of the eCommerce Directive.

The Court rejected the earlier assumption by Spanish courts that operators of websites linking to infringing contents online cannot be held criminally liable because they do not engage in acts of communication to the public.

The Court concluded that, due to the nature of its operation, The Pirate Bay could not rely on the protection afforded to some intermediaries under the E-Commerce Directive.

(2) The case, is also interesting as it considered whether a Swedish court could claim jurisdiction where part of the relevant conduct, in a copyright violation, had taken place abroad. It was clear that some of The Pirate Bay’s users (i.e. the ones committing the actual copyright infringements – the principal offense) were located outside Sweden at the time of committing the copyright infringements. The relevant law makes clear that an offense is regarded as committed where the criminal act took place as well as where the offense was competed (Chapter 2, section 4 Criminal Code). Thus, the courts had to decide where the principal offense was committed when The Pirate Bay’s users were located outside Sweden at the time of committing the copyright infringements. Had the Court concluded that the principal offenses in such cases had been committed outside Sweden, Swedish jurisdiction could be called into question and the application of Swedish law may not have been permitted. However, the District Court stated that: “According to the District Court, there are strong reasons to take the view that an offense that means that one makes accessible something via the Internet is committed in a country where an Internet user may access the information that is made available, provided that the making available has a effect on the legal rights held in that country [...]. This is particularly so where the information – as in this case – is published in a language spoken in that country. This suggests that all of the principal offenses, including those committed by persons located outside Sweden, shall be regarded as committed in Sweden, This conclusion is further supported by the fact that servers (computers) that have hosted The Pirate Bay website and tracker have been located in Sweden.” The Court of Appeal took a slightly more sophisticated approach discussing the matter at greater length but reached a similar conclusion since the torrent files were placed on servers in Sweden.]","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>) Importantly this case tested the <strong>scope of the protection afforded to intermediaries under the E-Commerce Directive</strong> as implemented into Swedish law.&nbsp;The Court concluded that, due to the nature of its operation, The Pirate Bay could not rely on the protection afforded to some intermediaries under the E-Commerce Directive.</div>

(1) The first procedure starts with a copyright owner accessing one of the P2P filesharing networks, and attempting to find and download a file to which he owns the copyright. Once he succeeds, he is supposed to record the IP address of the user who made the copyrighted file available, and send it to this user's ISP in the form of a Copyright Infringement Report (CIR). By virtue of s. 3 of the Act, the ISP is then required to forward this CIR to the allegedly infringing user. Should a user receive more than three CIRs, each of them separated from another by a specific period of time, he is to be put on this ISP's “copyright infringement list”. By virtue of s. 4, the copyright owner may demand the ISP to provide him with an anonymous list of all users who reached the threshold by infringing his copyright. Upon receiving the list, the copyright owner may then apply for a court injunction to identify the infringing users and commence infringement proceedings against them.

(2) The second procedure, known as the “obligations to limit Internet access”, is to be implemented only if the Secretary of State decides that the initial obligations regime does not perform sufficiently well in reducing online piracy, after at least a year of operation. This second procedure would impose an obligation on the ISPs to act upon the Internet connection of its subscribers who reached the threshold of CIRs or went above it. This could potentially include measures such as limiting the speed of the connection, preventing the subscriber from accessing certain online services, and (in the ultimate case) suspending the subscriber's connection altogether. However, none of the two procedures has actually been implemented.

(3) The initial obligations code, governing the operational aspects of the discussed procedures, has not appeared yet. Moreover, after a series of setbacks, the UK government announced that the initial obligations regime is to be activated in the second half of 2015.

(4) In addition to the “graduated response” procedures, section 17 of the DEA 2010 provides that the Secretary of State may introduce regulations explicitly providing the courts with an option of granting a blocking injunction against a “location on the internet” (most commonly, a website) which the court sees as “(…) being, or (…) likely to be used for or in connection with an activity that infringes copyright.” The online service provider who received the blocking injunction would have to “prevent its service being used to gain access” such a location. However, such regulations haven’t been established yet, and section 17 itself is potentially a subject to removal within the Draft Deregulation Bill 2013, clause 26 of which proposes omitting sections 17 and 18 of the DEA 2010.","<div>[The DEA 2010 introduced two key procedures aimed at reducing online piracy through the “graduated response” approach – procedures labelled as the “initial obligations” and the “obligations to limit Internet access”.</div>

However, such regulations haven’t been established yet, and section 17 itself is potentially a subject to removal within the Draft Deregulation Bill 2013, clause 26 of which proposes omitting sections 17 and 18 of the DEA 2010.]</div>","<div>The DEA 2010 introduced two key procedures aimed at reducing online piracy through the “graduated response” approach – procedures labelled as the “initial obligations” and the “obligations to limit Internet access”.</div>
<div>(<strong>1</strong>) The first procedure starts with a copyright owner accessing one of the P2P filesharing networks, and attempting to find and download a file to which he owns the copyright. Once he succeeds, he is supposed to record the IP address of the user who made the copyrighted file available, and send it to this user's ISP in the form of a Copyright Infringement Report (CIR). By virtue of s. 3 of the Act, the ISP is then required to forward this CIR to the allegedly infringing user. Should a user receive more than three CIRs, each of them separated from another by a specific period of time, he is to be put on this ISP's “copyright infringement list”. By virtue of s. 4, the copyright owner may demand the ISP to provide him with an anonymous list of all users who reached the threshold by infringing his copyright. Upon receiving the list, the copyright owner may then apply for a court injunction to identify the infringing users and commence infringement proceedings against them.</div>
<div>(<strong>2</strong>) The second procedure, known as the “obligations to limit Internet access”, is to be implemented only if the Secretary of State decides that the initial obligations regime does not perform sufficiently well in reducing online piracy, after at least a year of operation. This second procedure would impose an obligation on the ISPs to act upon the Internet connection of its subscribers who reached the threshold of CIRs or went above it. This could potentially include measures such as limiting the speed of the connection, preventing the subscriber from accessing certain online services, and (in the ultimate case) suspending the subscriber's connection altogether. However, none of the two procedures has actually been implemented.</div>

It was held that once Google is notified of the defamatory comments on Blogger and fails to remove them within a reasonable time, it might incur liability as the “secondary” publisher of said content. Regarding the defence set out in s. 1 of the Defamation Act 1996 (see above), it was held that Google could not be regarded as the publisher of the comments within the meaning of s. 1(2), and while the company was found to have taken reasonable care with regards to the publication of the statement, it could be denied the defence due to the finding that it knew or should have known that its activity is likely to prolong the publication of the defamatory material. However, the s. 1 defence was not applied in the end, since the Court of Appeal agreed with the court of the first instance that the damage caused by the defamatory comments at hand was of trivial character, and could not result in the finding of a real and substantial tort. Hence, the case was struck out.","<div>[A successful application for a “Newzbin 2” blocking injunction against two streaming websites (SolarMovie and TubePlus), which were found to facilitate copyright-infringing activities.]</div>","<div>A successful application for a “Newzbin 2” blocking injunction against two streaming websites (SolarMovie and TubePlus), which were found to facilitate copyright-infringing activities.</div>",United Kingdom,,DECISIONS - Lower Courts,2013,Court/Judicial Decision,Lowest Domestic Court,Civil,Defamation or Personality Rights,,Host (Including Social Networks),Mixed/Neutral/Unclear,Takedowct Upon Knowledge (Includes Notice and Takedown),,Block or Remove,,Trigger for OSP Obligations,,,,,,,Good/No Action Required,,,

The plaintiff, a former model, sought an order requiring Google and Yahoo to: (i) permanently block from the search results the links to webpages displaying prostitution ads and pornography whenever they included her name or images, which allegedly violated her constitutional rights; (ii) stop any commercial unauthorized use of her image and name, which allegedly infringed her publicity right and, (iii) pay damages.

(1) Specifically, the Court of Appeals first decided that strict liability is not compatible with freedom of expression and rejected the plaintiff’s request to apply strict liability.

(2) Second, Argentina’s doctrine for press media liability - under which the press are not liable for damages unless they fail to cite sources (“Campillay” doctrine) or act with some sort of bad intent (also known as the “real malice” doctrine) - is not necessarily applicable to other modes of expression.

(3) Third, the Court of Appeals applied the negligence standard to search engines linking to third parties’ content in search results. The Court created a test under which search engines will not be liable, if (i) content is produced by a third party; (ii) the claimant notifies the search engine, identifying the alleged infringing content; and (iii) the search engine acts expeditiously to block the content via some “quick and effective filtering method.”

(4) Finally, the appellate court considered image “thumbnails” displayed in search’s results as “Google’s own content”. These, therefore, fail the first prong of the new negligence test. No fair use defense is available under Argentinean law. Thus, Google must pay damages caused by the thumbnails, including, both for copyright and non-copyright claims, actual and moral damages, but not statutory damages, which are unavailable in the Argentinean legal system.]

[Appeal to this decision is now pending before the National Supreme Court of Justice. In contrast to the Court of Appeals, the Advocate General, who represents the public interest and submits non-binding opinions prior to a Supreme Court decision, sustained that the ""Campillay"" and the ""real malice"" doctines should be applied to this case (see above).] [See also CIS Blog post reporting on the case and the hearing before the Supreme Court].","<div>[This case is one among other&nbsp;civil lawsuits brought&nbsp;against the search engines Google and Yahoo! by different ‘celebrities’ and well‐known public figures for violation of their honor and privacy (see below Da Cuhna for more background information).&nbsp;The plaintiff, a former model, sought an order requiring Google and Yahoo to: (<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">i</strong>) permanently block from the search results the links to webpages displaying prostitution ads and pornography whenever they included her name or images, which allegedly violated her constitutional rights; (ii) stop any commercial unauthorized use of her image and name, which allegedly infringed her publicity right and, (iii) pay damages.&nbsp;</div>

The Court stated that Contributory Liability will be recognized only when three conditions have been met: (i) there was actual direct infringement; (ii) the contributor had actual knowledge of the direct infringement; and (iii) there was substantial, significant and actual contribution by contributor to the infringement.&nbsp;</div>",Israel,,DECISIONS - Superior Courts,2011,Court/Judicial Decision,Highest Domestic/national (including State) Court,Civil,Copyright,Secondary,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Good/No Action Required,http://www.law.co.il/media/computer-law/hebrew_university1.pdf,https://www.law.co.il/media/computer-law/hebrew_university1.pdf,https://www.law.co.il/media/computer-law/hebrew_university1.pdf

(2) The court mentioned the UK case about the use of Popcorn software, Twentieth Century Fox Corp. v. Sky  UK  Ltd., [2015] EWHC 1082 (Ch).

The Judge ruled that at this stage when the infringement was not proved, and it was not proved that the defendant was liable or has caused damages to plaintiffs there is no room to provide an injunction to the ISPs compelling them to reveal the identities of ISPs users.

(3) The Judge differentiated this case from NMC United Entertainment LTD et al. vs. Bloomberg et al.

Five Israeli music record companies sued the owners of the website Unidown and several ISPs claiming that the website enables users to listen and download music recording copyrighted by them without authorization. The Website claimed that it merely functions as a “search engine” allowing users to listen to music recordings through youtube.

(2) The District Court found that Unidown should be viewed as an infringing platform which enables the unauthorized download of copyrighted works in disguise of a “search engine”. The Judge claimed the problem is not with the technology but with the use been made of it. The court found with regard to the download function of Unidown, that the website enabled users through other websites to download music recordings unauthorized, and therefore, found it guilty of contributory liability to copyright infringement.

(3) With regard to the streaming option of Unidown, the Court found that since the website was directly connecting users to youtube, there was no direct infringement by the users and therefore, there cannot be contributory infringement with regard to the streaming option.

(4) Since the Judge found Unidown guilty of contributory infringement (for the download function) he does not settle the question of whether embedded links or content the way done by Unidown could give rise to other liability claims such as unjust enrichment or infringement of moral rights, and leaves the question pending.

(2) The Jordanian Civil Code is the primary source of law that should be consulted in cases as there is no specific provision in the Copyright Law in Jordan.

(3) Article 256 of the Jordanian Civil Code provides that ""[e]very injurious act shall render the person who commits it liable for damages even if he is a non-discerning person."" Three elements must be present for tort liability to arise under the Jordanian Civil Code: (i) a fault or error (which may be either an act or a failure to act); (ii) damage to another; and (iii) a causal connection between the fault and damage.

(4) “Vicarious liability” is not strictly defined in the Jordanian Civil Code as in the case of French law. (i) The major provisions concerning liability for another person’s act are to be found in Article 288 of the Jordanian Civil Code, which provides that: ""1. No person shall be liable for the act of another and yet the court may on the application of the injured person and if it finds justifiable hold liable for the awarded damages. A.

(1) Access to YouTube was initially blocked on March 27, 2014 by an order of the Presidency of Telecommunications and Communication (TİB), a few hours after recordings of a key security meeting on Syria leaked online. TIB's ban was unilaterally ordered by TIB without being supported by a judicial decision. (2) Initially, a local court in the Ankara’s Gölbaşı district justified the ban on the grounds of a law incriminating insults to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Turkish Republic. (3) On April 4, the Gölbaşı Court of Peace ordered that access to the website be unblocked, following an appeal from the Union of the Turkish Bar Associations. The court went on to say that the ban was too broad and in violation of freedom of speech. The Court recommended simply blocking 15 videos as oppose to the entire site. 4) The Gölbaşı Prosecutor’s Office objected to the ruling, arguing that the ban should remain in place because the 15 videos remain on the website and URL-specific blocking is not technically possible. (5) In response to the Prosecutor's objection, the Gölbaşı Criminal Court of First Instance, which is a higher court, reversed the earlier decision of April 5 by ruling that the ban will continue until the “criminal content” is removed by YouTube. (6) Finally, in response to an appeal filed by YouTube, the court revoked the preventive measure temporarily imposed and ruled previous verdicts that justified the ban on YouTube to “be declared null and void."" (7) According to this decision, TİB should unblock YouTube after it is officially notified of the ruling, even if YouTube does not remove the aforementioned videos. In fact, TİB decided not to enforce the court’s ruling to unblock Twitter and opted to wait for a Constitutional Court ruling to revoke the ban (see above).]","<div>[The Court finally ruled to unblock access to the popular video-sharing website YouTube, after initially ordering a temporary measure to reinstate the ban as per the prosecution’s request.&nbsp;(<strong style=""line-height: 1.538em;"">1</strong>)&nbsp;Access to <strong>YouTube</strong> was <strong>initially blocked</strong> on March 27, 2014 by an order of the Presidency of Telecommunications and Communication (<strong>TİB</strong>), a few hours after recordings of a key security meeting on Syria leaked online.

The court decided to sentence Ak for insulting and weakening the Republic of Turkey, the Military Forces, the Security Forces, and the Ministry of Justice, to one year in prison for each insult separately, totaling four years. Later, his sentence was reduced to 10 months for each insult, totaling 40 months. And on 12 March 2002 Istanbul Criminal Court No. 4 passed a second verdict against Coskun Ak. The sentence of 40 months' imprisonment was commuted to a fine of TL 6 million (app. $4). On 24 April, 2003, this second sentence was quashed by the Court of Appeal.</div>",Turkey,,DECISIONS - Lower Courts,1999,Court/Judicial Decision,Lowest Domestic Court,Criminal,Defamation or Personality Rights+Public Order,,Host (Including Social Networks)+Internet Access Provider (Including Mobile),,,,,,,,,,,,,No Link,,,
816,General Introduction - Mexico,General Introduction - Mexico,"(1) In Mexico there is no ad hoc legislation, such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The Copyright Law contemplates provisions which accommodate concepts such as fixation, reproduction or communication to the public in the digital environment. The Copyright Law does not make internet service providers (ISPs) liable or provide any safe harbours excluding liability in specific situations like caching, search engine, mere conduit or routing. The exceptions and limitations imposed by the Copyright Law are restrictive in scope and it would be difficult to invoke them in connection with digital rights. The Copyright Law of Mexico does not provide exceptions or limitations to copyright or neighboring rights in connection with the activities of ISPs or other intermediaries. Intermediaries in charge of connecting Internet sites operated by infringers of copyright or neighboring rights, are not clearly liable of infringement, namely indirect infringement, by providing means to the site operators –connecting their sites to an indeterminate number of users, but also providing software that users can employ for file sharing or other purposes- who then perpetrate infringement of rights in a direct fashion. No exception or limitation system can exist in the absence of rights or actions to enforce the same.

(2) Direct infringement has been explored, with success, in connection with works disseminated over the Internet, based on the economic right of access that derives from WIPO Treaties. The access right has been tested in a number of cases related to the film and music industries. The most significant case in Mexico has been MPAA v. SigloX.com. As a result of that case, the site was dismantled, the server seized and one employee convicted.

(3) Secondary liability of intermediaries has been debated at a government level, with the participation of groups or association like the Business Software Alliance (BSA), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), a number of collecting societies, as well as the largest ISPs in the country, that include Telmex and Telefonica. However, they have not convinced that ISPs can be liable for secondary copyright infringement, because the Copyright Law or international treaties do not deal with the issue. Among the proposals made, a bill was introduced in 2010 adopting a three-strike system and using the French HADOPI 2 as a model.

(4) Civil liability tools have been tried. Collective societies have threatened with litigation against ISPs, but not under the provisions contained in the Mexican Copyright Law (because there are none concerning these matters), some of them are instead trying to rely on civil law principles such as subjective liability. However, being civil in nature, it has been questionable whether it can apply to infringement matters deriving from the Copyright Law. Likewise, the civil theory is narrow in scope, and would not easily accommodate to non-common situations dealing with special rights. Moreover, issues like assistance or inducement are additional factors that can complicate the application of civil liability doctrines. For ISPs in Mexico, the balance inclines to their side, taking into account that the Copyright Law does not recognize their liability. Copyright holders cannot invoke any sort of legal actions against intermediaries unless they perform direct infringement. However, as in other jurisdictions, the question remains if it can be justified that intermediaries are held liable of indirect copyright infringement for connecting users, regardless if these latter engage in wrong doing.

(5)  The non contractual theory of strict liability could be a way of proceeding against ISPs but effective results seem unlikely. The concept of 'strict liability' is defined in Article 1913 of the Civil Code in the following manner: ""When a person operates machines, any instrument or substance that is inherently dangerous [ . . . ] such person is obliged to repair the damage caused by such instruments, even if the person does not act in an unlawful manner, unless that person proves that the damage was a consequence of the inexcusable fault or gross negligence of the injured party."" Judicial precedent demonstrates that strict liability is based on a non-contractual theory of liability. Judicial decisions have stated that when a party to an agreement involving 'inherently dangerous' instruments is injured, the basis for imposing strict liability is not found in the agreement itself, but rather in the law. Strict liability will be imposed when dangerous instruments cause damage, regardless of whether a contractual relationship existed between the parties. There are situations in which both contractual liability and strict liability may exist: one cause of action can derive from the breach of the contract, and the other from the use of dangerous instruments. In such a case both causes of action can arise and may be exercised. In comparison, strict liability is closely related to subjective non-contractual liability. In both the damages or injuries are a result of a person's wilful acts. However, under strict liability the person's acts are not actually the source of the liability. Rather, strict liability results from the risk inherent in the use of certain objects. Legal theory classifies this type of liability as 'created risk' liability due to the fact that the person using such objects knows (or should know) the dangers involved in their use. Article 1913 governs only situations in which damages result not from an unlawful act but from a created risk. When the cause of the damages is an unlawful act only, then Article 1910 applies: ""A person, while acting in an unlawful manner or against recognized usage, who causes a harm to a third party is obliged to repair the damage, unless it is established that the damage was derived as a result of the inexcusable fault or the gross negligence of the injured party.""","<div><u><strong>SUMMARY</strong></u><strong> </strong>(provided by <a href=""http://mx.linkedin.com/pub/jose-francisco-camarena/7/40b/b48"">Jose Camarena</a>): (<strong>1</strong>)&nbsp;In Mexico there is <strong>no ad hoc legislation</strong>, such as the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).

The purpose of the bill is to implement a three-strikes system that resembles HADOPI 2.

Google México, S. de R.L.</a>, PPD.0094/14, January 2015</strong></div>","[(1) The Mexican National Institute for the Access to Information (INAI) ruled in favor of a transportation magnate, Carlos Sánchez de la Peña, who wanted three links removed from Google search results. The links contained negative comments about the business dealings of Mr. Sánchez’s family—including a government bailout of bad loans. The INAI heard the case after Google Mexico rejected a petition from Mr. Sánchez de la Peña to have the links removed.

(2) In his request to INAI, Mr. Sánchez claimed that the three Google links distorted and decontextualized information about his activities as an entrepreneur. Mr. Sánchez de la Peña’s family has owned “Estrella Blanca” bus lines for generations. One of the links directed to an article about a lawsuit against Mr. Sánchez’s father, Salvador Sánchez Alcántara, by shareholders in the bus company. Mr. Sánchez de la Peña is named in the story and the snippet accompanying the link. The article also discusses how the company received millions of dollars in loans from Mexican banks that collapsed during the country’s financial crisis in the mid-1990s. The loans, most of them past-due, were absorbed by Mexico’s bank-bailout fund known as IPAB.

(3) The Federal Law on Protection of Personal Data Held by Private Parties, provides a set of rights called “ARCO rights”, that refer to the rights of Access, Rectification, Cancellation and Objection, that data owners can exercise against the processing of their personal data by private parties (see above). The Regulations to the Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data further qualify those rights (see above). However, the principle according to which a person can request the cancellation of his personal data is very vague. Also, limitations to said cancellation right seem highly discretionary and vaguely defined under Article 26 of the Law as well as under Article 88 of the Regulations. The INAI commissioners considered that Mr. Sánchez met the privacy-law requirements that allow for the removal of information when its “persistence causes injury” even if the information was lawfully published.

(4) Mexico’s data privacy law contains exceptions to Internet privacy rules if the information is in the public interest. The INAI, however, didn’t apply the exception, arguing that Google didn’t claim those exceptions when making its case.

(5) The INAI ordered the removal only from google.com.mx. Mexico’s data privacy law only requires the removal of links from local search engines.

(6) Google will be challenging the INAI ruling before the ordinary courts. Google Mexico considers that the INAI decision infringes on the right to access to information and freedom of speech. Free-speech advocates sided with Google Mexico by noting that the INAI ruling would allow politicians and business tycoons to abuse the so-called right to be forgotten by wiping out Internet links that cast them in a negative light. Activists and advocates are warning society about the negative effects of this type of rulings, especially in countries like Mexico, where the independent press and media are still fighting against censorship. The INAI ruling removes pieces of information that are essential for academics, think tanks and critical journalists in their work to hold elusive and criminal government officials accountable for their deeds before Mexican society.]","<div>[(<strong>1</strong>)&nbsp;The Mexican National Institute for the Access to Information (INAI) ruled in favor of a transportation magnate, Carlos Sánchez de la Peña, who wanted three links removed from Google search results.

The Regulations to the Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data further qualify those rights (see above). However, the principle according to which a person can request the cancellation of his personal data is very vague. Also, limitations to said cancellation right seem highly discretionary and vaguely defined under Article 26 of the Law as well as under Article 88 of the Regulations. The INAI commissioners considered that Mr. Sánchez met the privacy-law requirements that allow for the removal of information when its “persistence causes injury” even if the information was lawfully published.</div>
<div>(<strong>4</strong>) Mexico’s data privacy law contains exceptions to Internet privacy rules if the information is in the public interest. The INAI, however, didn’t apply the exception, arguing that Google didn’t claim those exceptions when making its case.&nbsp;</div>
<div>(<strong>5</strong>) The INAI ordered the removal only from google.com.mx. Mexico’s data privacy law only requires the removal of links from local search engines.</div>
<div>(<strong>6</strong>) Google will be challenging the INAI ruling before the ordinary courts. Google Mexico considers that the INAI decision infringes on the right to access to information and freedom of speech. Free-speech advocates sided with Google Mexico by noting that the INAI ruling would allow politicians and business tycoons to abuse the so-called right to be forgotten by wiping out Internet links that cast them in a negative light. Activists and advocates are warning society about the negative effects of this type of rulings, especially in countries like Mexico, where the independent press and media are still fighting against censorship. The INAI ruling removes pieces of information that are essential for academics, think tanks and critical journalists in their work to hold elusive and criminal government officials accountable for their deeds before Mexican society.</div>",Mexico,,DECISIONS - Administrative Procedure or Enforcement,2015,Administrative Decision,Administrative Authority,Civil,Privacy or Data Protection+Right to Be Forgotten+Jurisdiction,,Search Engine or Index,Weakens Immunity,Takedowct Upon Knowledge (Includes Notice and Takedown),,Block or Remove,,"Limitation on Scope of Compliance (Geographic, Temporal, etc.)",,,,,,,Good/No Action Required,http://http://inicio.ifai.org.mx/pdf/resoluciones/2014/PPD%2094.pdf,http://inicio.ifai.org.mx/pdf/resoluciones/2014/PPD%2094.pdf,http://inicio.ifai.org.mx/pdf/resoluciones/2014/PPD%2094.pdf
826,"Copyright Modernization Act, SC 2012, c 20.","<div><strong><a href=""http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2012_20/page-1.html"">Copyright Modernization Act</a>, SC 2012, c 20.</strong></div>","[(1) This is an amending Act to the Copyright Act (see below). Section 31.1 expands the exemption granted by section 2.4(1)(4) of the Copyright Act and is essentially a codification of the holdings from SOCAN v CAIP (see below). Section 31.1(1) states that ISPs, provided that they are content neutral, cannot be held liable by providing any means for Internet access. The fact that “any means” for telecommunication is used instead of “the means” necessary for telecommunication, which appears in section 2.4(1)(b), signifies that this provision is intended to cover a wider range of intermediaries that provide access to third party content such as bloggers, video and social networking websites. Moreover, whereas section 2.4(1)(b) is only applicable in cases where the intermediary is involved in the communication of copyright materials, section 31.1(1) covers both communication and reproduction of those materials.

(2) The protection granted by section 31.1 also applies to hosting and caching activities. By virtue of sections 31.1(2) and 31.1(3), ISPs are protected from copyright infringement as a result of caching or other “incidental” acts that provide more efficient Internet services.  Further, under section 31.1(4), ISPs are immune from copyright liability related to hosting unless they know the content provider has been found by a court to infringe copyright. One exception to section 31.1 exists however; it is not available to intermediaries whose primary function is to enable copyright infringement (see section 27(2.3) below).

(3) Another key provision this Act sets out is the “notice and notice” regime. Since 2000, many major ISPs have successfully dealt with copyright infringement claims using the informal notice and notice system put in place by the Canadian Association of Internet Providers (CAIP) and the music and cable industry. Therefore, sections 41.25 – 41.27 outlines a system are already familiar to major SPIs (note: sections 41.25 and 41.26 are not yet in force). Under the notice and notice regime, a copyright holder can report an infringement by sending a notice to the SPI. The notice must be in writing and include the claimant’s name and address, the material relating to the alleged infringement, the claimant’s interest in the copyright, the type of infringement as well as the location and time of the alleged infringement. Once the ISP receives the notice, it must promptly forward it to the accused subscriber. ISPs are also required to maintain a record of the user who owns the electronic location at which the alleged copyright infringement occurred. This record must be retained for six months but can be extended to one year if an action is commenced. Where the ISP fails to carry out its obligations, it will be liable for statutory damages ranging from $5,000 to $10,000.  However, an exception has been made for search engines or what the Act refers to as “information location tools”. According to section 41.27, as long as search engines are content neutral and not guilty of enabling infringement (see section 27(2.3) below), remedies against them are limited to injunctions.

(4) One area the Act is unclear about is under what circumstance will ISPs be held liable for authorizing copyright infringement. According to the decision in SOCAN v CAIP (see below), an ISP may be liable for authorizing infringement if it has notice of a potential copyright infringement and did not take remedial action. Aside from hosting, where liability seem to follow only if the ISP is aware of a court decision confirming the copyright infringement, it remains to be seen whether forwarding a notice to the content provider will be sufficient to meet the “remedial action” requirement or whether more is needed to avoid liability as an authorizer.

(5) The Copyright Modernization Act introduces a new basis for ISP liability. According to section 27(2.3), an SPI can incur secondary liability if its service is primarily intended for enabling copyright infringement. What constitute as “enabling” will be determined in light of numerous factors such as how the service was marketed by the ISP and whether it has other functions aside from enabling acts of copyright infringement.

The Court denied the claimants royalties for copyrighted materials that were transferred on the Internet. It interpreted section 2.4(1)(b) of the Copyright Act (the “common carrier exception”) and found that ISPs are not liable as long as they are “conduit” for information (para 32). That is, if an intermediary remains content neutral, they are considered not to have communicated the content at all (para 111). For this reason, intermediaries are also immune from defamation liability (para 89). Whether an intermediary is regarded a conduit for information and thus qualifying for immunity under this section will primarily depend on its function.

(2) To successfully use the “innocent disseminator” defence in a defamation action, an intermediary must show that it a) did not know about the publication of the libel; b) did not have any reason to suspect its presence (e.g., by receiving a notice); and c) was not negligent in detecting it.

(3) For the purpose of s. 2.4(1)(b), “necessary” means of telecommunication is a means that is “reasonably useful and proper” to achieve the benefits of enhanced economy and efficiency’’ and “of greater or lesser benefit or convenience” (para 91). Previously, the Federal Court of Appeal found that a means is “necessary” only if “communication in that medium of telecommunication would not be practicable or, in all probability, would not have occurred’’ without it (para 113). However, the Supreme Court rejected this high threshold due to the chilling effects it might have on ISPs’ efforts to expand their operations and develop more efficient means of telecommunication.

(4) The “means” of telecommunication was held not to be limited to routers and hardware. Rather, it includes all “software connection equipment, connectivity services, hosting and other facilities and services without which such communications would not occur” (para 92). Therefore, this section protects the providers of these means of telecommunication as well.

(5) The protection offered by section 2.4(1)(b) also extends to caching and hosting activities. Caching technology was found to be content neutral. Applying the new threshold, caches were found to be a necessary means of telecommunication since they were developed for the very purpose of enabling a more economical way of transmitting large files.  With regards to hosting, ISPs are generally not liable for copyright infringement by contents stored on their servers because the user, and not the intermediary, is deemed to be the content provider. Given the large amount of data being transmitted through the Internet, the Supreme Court noted that it would not be feasible for intermediaries to detect all the material that infringes copyright. However, where an ISP has knowledge of copyrighted content but fails to take remedial steps (para 124), liability may ensue since a failure to respond may constitute authorizing the infringement.

(6) Further, the Court confirmed the findings in CCH Canadian v LSUC (see below) that liability for authorizing copyright infringement will only follow if ISPs “give approval to; sanction, permit; favour, [or] encourage” the infringing conduct (para 127). That is, simply knowing that a neutral technology, such as hosting, might be used to violate copyright laws is not sufficient to support a finding of authorization.

(7) Finally, the case discussed the issue of jurisdiction of the Copyright Act. To determine whether the infringing activity occurred in Canada, the “real and substantial connection” test should be used. Where there is a real and substantial link between the infringing activity and Canada, the Copyright Act will apply. Whether such a connection exists will depend on the specific facts of each case so that the location of the host server will not be determinative. Therefore, an intermediary may not necessarily be liable under the Copyright Act because its host servers are located in Canada.

The Supreme Court ruled that the LSUC did not infringe copyright because its dealings with the claimants’ work were for the research purpose of its patrons and was fair.
